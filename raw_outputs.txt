The ongoing awareness that this is a cultural problem has not led to smart policy decisions, it has instead led to a series of crises: We have a debt crisis that is essentially a write-off; we have a race to save money; and we have a tech bubble.
This has caused a breakdown in communication¬†around longer term¬†changes to the economy. As a result, people are distracted in relatively short term scenarios that need to be reflected more visual than they have been in without the internet and people don't talk about it.
Lots of people have said how they wish the internet wasn't in the bedroom. But, I blame web clones.
There is a perception in the west that dominance is experienced only in the wild when it comes to a foreign language that people can't read or understand. However, this is often like saying that your father's skin condition was only experienced in a dark bathroom when you were in school.

GIRL ON YOUR PSYCHELL: A month of online dating tips from someone who can't sleep, eats the same vegetables and drinks beer all the time


You want to meet someone who can make you laugh? Then you can thank your cheating brain instead of your heart.

Now you can meet someone who can make you cry.

You turn to your brain in tears when you meet someone you're forgetting is beautiful.

But once that kiss starts, you dangle the worst vices trying to justify it.

How to meet people with your heart but your mind

This is how you meet people who change your life.

You meet a person you wish you met five years ago.

You wanted to meet for a year or 100, but a digital relationship becomes too draining.

Or the past year has been too stressful for you to give up.

The Croatian restaurant is exceptional in feel: a kitchen/bar, a bar area, an outdoor patio, view from big front porch. As a fun side-trip I settled on a couple of drinks here during long activities and enjoyed learning some Croatian. The staff was friendly and helpful dealing with my Irish footsteps. Conveniently located in Fisherman's Wharf.
Hard to beat the restaurant at Kalapeka. I've checked out their menu, and it was pretty unremarkable, probably because I'd never hit the menu button and had no idea what I was looking at. They also have some good curry dishes as well if you're into that stuff. This is one of the new wave of authentic, innovative restaurants to hit town.
#1. Starbucks Coffee to Patio with coffee    This was so close to happening.  I met the owner, Marcellus, and his grandsons- he had been grubbing in the backyard of his home for a year or two and didn't have a full-time job. They took him under my wing for this proposed restaurant.  The owner told me about his blue-collar upbringing. His parents worked 24 hours a day on the rail and gas lines.  He told me about the time he got locked out of the McDonald's and his grunts being miserable, and we started planning.
So close

Daphnis:  Is there any room for 2?
Martin:  Yeah, 3. I have made sure.   I have put it on my desk. I'm going to take some time today to think about it.
Daphnis:  I can see that.  What am I missing?  How can you make a commitment to a 3 to me?
Martin:  Daphnis -   I want to spend my life being affected by technology.   I know that it's hard.  I know that it's hard for everyone.  But I have always believed in solidarity, that we stand together, that we can be strong for each other.  One of the benefits of technology is increased vulnerability. x
Daphnis:  That's great.  Such a simple concept.
Martin:  Daphnis -   Paul -                 The only thing we don't always agree on is taxation.   You learn to live with it.     Epic, miraculous progress, but easy to moan.
Daphnis:  Well, thanks dad.  Thank you for answering your questions.   If you're in the UK, you can come see me in London in January.

KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Police in Kyiv on Tuesday arrested a passenger who dumped a life jacket in the toilet of a flight departure terminal to retrieve it following a flight delay, the Ukrainian Investigative Committee said in a statement.
American Michael Cheyne, 28, was found carrying $40.49 of bank money in a bag early on Tuesday as he boarded a flight from Los Angeles to Kyiv, Ukraine's investigative committee said.

The passenger dumped the find by the toilet where it was intended to be deposited following a flight delay in Kyiv's Sheremetyiv International Airport, prosecutors said.
Reuters confirmed someone was named Rashad bin Zayed al Nahyan. Passengers fall into buckets during a flight from California to Dubai November 21, 2013. REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoon/Files
It said the find came about after a similar incident on March 29, 2007, when a luggage container was found empty, to the point that it was subsequently moved and subsequently reestablished as a Jules Verne type maze of security lines.

During the recent Apple WWDC keynote, one of the topics of discussion was the cloud / mobile future. In particular, wewere impressed with how much mobile apps are being built and developed today.   As a developer, I like having access to such fast and ready-to-use sources, so that I can specifically find what I need faster and easier.  This leads me to my next topic. 
I'm currently (at the moment) in MWC 2017 in Barcelona and can tell you from the get-go, there's a lot of love for the enterprise.   While there were some mockups for the Hub office/home, the majority of it has to do with the Apple Watch.  So without further adieu, click on the image below to see the inside on what people are thinking about on the enterprise side of the Apple Watch.     https://t.co/jc3j0R0fMQ

Here's the current log:
3/7/15 - Feeling a little tired. Breathing like a healthy human. Not feeling threatened. Feeling relaxed after a long day, just happy to be alive.
Wednesday (i'm in the middle of a long Memorial Day weekend, but in the middle of the week). About 80% of my time is prior to bed.   4-6 hours of downtime in the middle of the night is just... enjoy life.
Revision Log - 3/10/2015 - Created an Instagram. Snapchat isn't the best, but #lightspin is. A conversation with the owners of @VibeRooftop started off the conversation and moved some people's minds. Just felt like the IG was right up my alley.
3/7/15 - Started working out. Lifting weights helps my body and mind. I started exercising in the gym on Monday but it was still very unproductive.
3/8/15 - Working on VPNs and VPNs helped calm stress. My wifi tracks my location and apps etc, which made sense

Over the course of an hour and a half yesterday, one was born.   I love you Jose and thank you soooooo much for supporting my baby!

To the extent possible under law, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have waived all rights to a redress of claims under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Antitrust Laws to former employees.   The undersigned hereby submits that this waiver should be construed as granting an affirmative defence in right of ~201 employees affected by the Company's Foreign Exchange Operations restructuring.  This waiver is not a legal junket, but rather an act of voluntary self-assessment  by ~203 employees.
Finance = Tool: I make money by discovering, writing about, and sharing my unique insights with others.  My writing is based on my background inquiry and my understanding of finance.  By my own estimation, I earn an annual income in the neighborhood of ~150k, a substantial chunk of which I am expected to reinvest in my investing.   Using my own analysis of the ~201% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees affected by the foreign exchange operations restructuring,¬†further confirmation is almost certainly required.   The total compensation offered for these employees is, well, $124,315, which is an amazing statistic.
The bottom line:   You CAN earn ~$124,315 in the month of July, 2016, the same month Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been forced to pay finance employees $250,000 prior to the normal 12-week clearance

The social media apocalypse has hit India. The bad news is not new. The bad news is coming at anyone's speed, or a lot of it.

This is why Google waives advertising rates like the NFL, NBA, NHL and others.

Companies don't want you running into this situation.

Google Ads is not the same new of offense it was in August 2015, courtesy of a steady stream of high yield letters. There was no Tolstoy, and no thesaurus or dictionary.

All things read at your speed, or slow.

The early Olbers of the world made it clear that you want to communicate speed.

Google's argument is that if it lets performance become the model, it will maintain lower cost advertising (more eyeballs, fewer ads, etc).

Bargaining?

Making money?

Governance.

Aspirational.

Water or ice?

====================
For more than two decades, the PETO experiment has been the dominant paradigm in our understanding of human-centered intelligence. Unfortunately, the experimental design‚Äîalong with a three-year lack of funding‚Äîhave prevented an accurate analysis. We need to investigate if the results of PETO are worthy of further scrutiny.
The Peto experiment has become a metaphor for human culture, but it's become a metaphor for human culture in a different way.
Whether you believe in the success or failure of a leader, a leader's success solely depends on his or her ability to shape the culture of the group.
When our culture interacts with the work environment, we develop an additional set of expectations, and this creates an environment in which people are cast into a looping cycle of what we expect them to do.
When we get bored with work, we say "the work is meaningless" or "the work is not worth the time."
Through repetition, we reinforce our negative beliefs and evaluation of others.
We are competitive and often feel entitled to our own view of the world. We focus in on what people see and what they think. This also extends to the individual, and judgment is based on what is "cool" or popular.
On the surface, you see these traits in people from all walks of life. However, in reality, the process is highly improbable, because the

To follow the logic was rather critical for him because he didn't think that there was a way out at the moment. So he was like...

He would get out of the way as far as possible but his problems were still there and he was going to have to do this. It was a pretty long fight and it was a very risky fight. My bad but!

He really got into it first because it's a very scary thing to think about but he had no real solution. He had a great time talking but he had a really bad time doing it.

He had to do it because he didn't have a way out.

He what died at the end was the resilience of a human being in the face of things that made him want to hide.

Doomed to be frozen.

The end result was... try as he might and ineffectively he just couldn't . The seeds of his destruction were all there.

I just think that's really, really creative and inspirational coming from Noam.

There's no better way to know if you are going to be a bit of a loser or not than "simplified."

How to stick to your plan and make progress. By Andrew Conrad.

The Japanese are a lot like the Americans.

Your plan B works better when your plan A doesn't work so well.

When is a plan worth pursuing?

An example of how you can make a plan work better is with an x.

If you know when to quit doing anything, you can make it work.

What a false choice!

It may make sense to learn how to do something or not to do it.

Always go small. If you think you can only do something once, your mind will keep doing things and you will never accomplish anything.

The Ancient Egyptian Way.

Friendship in ten faces:

Here's how you determine when to let go.

Your phone tells you what you're looking for about 20% of the time. What it omits about 50% and what you learn is often lost.

Mastering choice.

Like the fruit flies on an apple, small details can make a giant difference.

No one's life will change for the better, but you can change your own.

" If you want to organize a community you need a set of rules &amp; what you're going to organize inside your community.
Why here?  - Break things down - Thread as a thread - Frame each thread as a thread - Tweet on each thread  - Frame each thread as a thread - Create an official thread for each community  - Build a space to structure individual threads with a timeline for each thread - Be able to share your content publicly - Build community¬†boards  - Create communities for corporations, local community.
"Make history in this community for your actions in these communities for real for a generation. We need some customization and this is it."
"Balancing the clock is a lifestyle. Control over time makes it yours. Don't just watch your favorite movies tomorrow, you can make it happen tomorrow."
The most commonly asked questions are  1. What is this community for?  The T-Rex community started as a subreddit  - The T-Rex subreddit is a community for T-Rex enthusiasts so people can meet up and have fun - You get tied in with T-Rex brands, events, and gifts - You can start an event or start a community with The T-Rex Community. The T-Rex community is finally making it's way to the new timeline. 2. How can I join an event?

Always have a plan -  Because better plan = better outcome.   Even if it's a crappy plan.   We don't do plans to be original. We do plans to solve problems.
Run in a straight line, not fuss over the details.
Are you thinking the same way? Good. Get moving. Stay the rest of the year.
These are the things I do every day.
As I was traveling the world last year, I was thinking about 2015.   One of my favorite musicians was a dude named Tool.  40 #@!% out of a stream of 75, he never stopped sharing.

One of my favourite things about working on Diaspora is the diaspora community and the support community it engenders in me.


The most positive example of this is the Diaspora community Slack channel (#bridge) I used to start this journey.

I run this and it's a huge part of how I get things done. It's rock solid, with a steady stream of messages from strangers.

My Diaspora alumni community and Slack channel.

I think a big thing that we grow up with is the idea of "what if" and "what if" is what's missing from communication these days. Diaspora community is a perfect example.

The Twitter of the 21st century.

What if we started Slack because and @TownsquareMedia (Me) was tall as a eucalyptus tree

What if we, @Lawrencebeer and @swungen released 2 music videos about Richard Lewis

What if we released a music video of Elliott Smith singing "Little Red Rooster"

What if we, @Lawrencebeer, @swungen and @miehl won the lottery and had no regrets

That's my attitude right now. Instagram is a great place to start but it's not strong enough for what I want to achieve.

Twitter is a good place to

The Golstein-Goodman Restraint Rule: Introducing Guaranteed Financial Independence
Posted by Mark Munro Traditionally, the ambition to be free of financial risk has been highly valued. Many people aspire to be the Wealth Model Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and rise to become millionaires.
There is a huge difference between wealth, and money.   The more important one is, the easier money to secure.   The FTSE 100 index, is a good proxy for just this.   The market melted down as the market closed at 0 (the strong run coming to an end) and the negative trend line extended much further than most investors would have expected.   The dominant ten I buy¬†sold at prices below the multiples¬†they were trading at  once the index closed.    Every day, the cheapest selling index reaches the equivalent of the FTSE 100, and we are witnessing diminishing returns on our wealth.
The bottom line--the desire to be free of financial risk has abounded since the beginning of time.   Capital and financial power has no bearing on flexibility of intention.  ¬†Financial freedom defined by simplicity is also what it's all about. No long distance bill. No corporate activities. No more markets. No more women. No more¬†avoids getting that paper to your job on time.   Forget owning

Shuttle Tickets

Get on the blue line and ride the next 20 minutes. You can buy a seat

Or buy an upgrade.

You can upgrade for $30 a year for a seat 20 minutes before peak.

You can upgrade for $90 a year for a seat 30 minutes before peak.

Upgrade to an anniversary seat for $50. That's right.

If you feel like it, why not just buy an upgrade seat for the duration of your stay?

Think you can do better than me? Let's do this

What was your favorite meal before your stay?

Eating out was a good way to recharge. I always made sure I finished before heading out.

The food I had before my stay is still "avoiced" for $3 extra.

Did you get the $50 upgrade seat?

Get the $50 upgrade seat now

It was a great way to recharge my battery.

Awe-inspiring.

After we got it, we were a little worried that we weren't going to use it. So we bought more seats.

Purchasing the upgrade seat was a great "write off" for our little balance sheet.

First upgrade seat. Fine here.

And finally! I am reading the newspaper.

The police drama isn't the same as the family drama. Both involve saving a loved one.

The term #firstworldproblems is often framed as a way to reduce (but not eliminate)  facing unforeseen challenges.  However, the reality is that #firstworldproblems is a term used to describe small problems in life outside of the big challenges.  In this case, one can understand why it might seem so complicated:   With #firstworldproblems, there is no #firstworldproblem but a small, comparatively minor problem.   #firstworldproblems is a social catchphrase in the sense that it's used to help people ditch big problems and focus all their energy on #firstworldproblems.
With this in mind, I find myself using the term #firstworldproblems quite frequently.   Over the years I've found that #firstworldproblems is a good reflection of the frustration, frustration over not receiving attention, frustration with people I'm focused on, frustration with outcomes instead

The best iteration goes something like this:  1. Start with unproductive . 2. Flip a few units  3. Turn the unproductive units into productive ones. 4. Repeat. 5. Don't interrupt.   So instead of burning 10 hours on an hourly basis to develop a 3 month list of podcasts, you'll burn 10 hours in one week practicing a 24 hour list of podcasts.

 Back in February of 2014, I wrote an article called 50 Investors You Should Avoid Ordinary People In This Age of Desire. In that article, I shared my top recommendations for finding online investors. Sigh. Some weeks later, I was approached by someone who had the exact same idea.   My days have gone so much better and the thought that he might ever succeed at anything in life has exponentially increased in my mind.
The genius of this idea is that it's mixing two entirely different categories of people:  The idiots who want to be successful online and the people who want to potentially start a business online.

PRINCETON, NJ -- The Public Religion Research Institute's (PRRI) latest survey finds that only 33% of Americans believe the government has a responsibility to enforce the law, and that 43% feel the government is not responsible.


This indicates that President Obama deserves credit for helping to lower those numbers.

The recent Pew survey of American attitudes on ease of making personal relationships more relaxed also found that only 33% of Americans believe the government has a responsibility to enforce the law ‚Äî and that only 41% feel that the government is not responsible.


One of the reasons for this Thanksgiving holiday turnout in the U.S. (or overall public attitudes) is that people are willing to make personal relationships more comfortable. Whether it's on Thanksgiving (lots of people coming out to eat), at work (coffee shops across the country closing), or on a holiday (more and more people having holidays) it's a good time to build a more open-minded public. People are more willing to put down hard stuff in light of the holidays.

A big part of the drop in the Gallup version of Thanksgiving since 2010 is the correlation between increased tolerance for the sliding scale of personal relationships and reduced trust in the government. Last year about 52% of Americans said they trusted the Government. In 2010, that number was down to 38%. The trend toward fewer trust in

A portuguese man has been sentenced to three years in prison for revealing paedophile gangs online.

The convict, 28-year-old Tapiari Buco, confessed to sending a photo of a naked man being sexually assaulted when he was 16.

The scandal follows a series of high profile cases of online child abuse


Investigators said three young boys were shown explicit images of a girl and said they identified the man who sent the images.

A jury handed him a three-year sentence in front of a packed court.

But evidence showed he was only caught by social media, and he could have received a longer sentence

Tapiari Buco confessed to sending a photo of a naked man being sexually assaulted when he was 16

The biggest case of internet pedophilia anyone has ever seen emerged during the first weeks of 2014 in Portuguese social media.

And what you've just read is just one example of the many cases presented to you.

But has it stopped the 'dark net' online?

Several members of the 'dark net' have already been convicted of child porn.

Which will help explain why this of course takes the online child sex industry to a whole new level.<|endoftext|>The latest version of Vim

Taking another detour from the multiple digit being a good measure for pain, we can also consider its efficiency. After all, as people's numbers increase, they have to add more and more digits to their total.
A 1 is an outcome that is reached practically on average once every few years. But looking at the cumulative number of people who could have done something to address this outcome (150,000) and not do so. It's an accountable thing to do.

Opinions are divided here.  And some disagree.  Some agree.  It seems there's a good number of people who believe this whole thing is a fool's errand.   Enough 'I said I meant it' that I think I've identified what it is:
We need a guide on the ERB.   How to deploy?  How to deploy under uncertainty?  How to deploy without feeling like you're trashing the ERB?
Morning Briefing:  There's an uncertain future for the world economy.  As much as I want to tear up the ERB, I can't.   It's not all bad.  It's not all bad for the economy.  But entrepreneurship impacts everything.
The only thing worse than being poor is being poor, over-confident, and overworked.  It's the same theme with being rich (and getting rich)
Every strategy is an unintended consequence.  One thing that needs to change is how we plan.   It's not top exec time.   It's planning time.
I hope you're sitting down today.  Here's what's the biggest thing our ERB needs to do, but we don't do.

Something strange is going on at Capital One.

But what is it?

Just two questions, in no particular order:

(1) What are the things that are leading to the stop selling and then to slow up (2)What's the new one?

Let's start with Q1


(1)

Capital One is slow on Q1. Were it not for investors phasing down capital gains and dividends. But investors are really opting for digital currencies.

(2)

I'd say the artificial intelligence behind such things as the Napster file sharing service is smarter than ever.

Also, what's the new one?

Why, plenty of money.

Opinions on what's going on:

1. Humans are scared of capital.

2. If math and science were as scary as anything in this world, perhaps the nastiness of the market would have nuked them.

3. The stock market is traded on emotion.

4. The moon landing is a myth and why would you believe that any more.

5. The freedom of having a personal blog.
====================
Swooping dried grass into your intestines can't be good for you.
You can't judge people by what they want to get better at.  In order to get the best possible outcome, you need to assess your opponent's priorities.  #3 - You view the details.  You view many aspects of a person.   You're interested in the inner workings.  #2 - You have a tendency to narrow your focus.   You want to see things in a big-picture way but don't want to miss any details.  #1 - You show no empathy. You expect someone else to break down the details for you.
A man who grew up in a household without eyes and ears is a fool.  People who grew up without ears and ears that are always on and never off are fools.
The strongest bonds are the most difficult to break.  But you're also doing a disservice to them by neglecting these things.
Be intentional and indulge in the big picture.
The eye defines us.
When we live our lives in the present moment, our minds copy each other.  Our attention is constantly diverted.  But when we view the bigger picture, it's easier to differentiate between someone else's original intention and what's happening in your own mind.
Because we can only see the problem we're trying to solve

Investors make bad decisions because they have no sense of their own worth.    They go around looking for new people to bankroll their idea.   They believe in the idea that the market is trustworthy, and they invest in their friends and family.   Never for a second do they think that there is someone worse off when their investment is down.   The market is constantly rescuing shit up.   If you're invested in one, you're screwed!

How to write a startup blog post:   -Rate it  -Ask yourself "What will my readers tell me if they get anywhere with Facebook?" -Talk about how much they actually want to become an author -Ask "What are the 5 things I did in my startup to get publishable?" -Attempt to network with the reader -Open up about writing/business, platform, and usage  Notes: -Think "marketing" -Interact with reader/site in an effort to gain learnings  -Truly get the legwork -Design what you want to be seen as a startup
@JonathanGarrett @Twitter Trolls have never been so annoying.

9/ The correct response is never to some other person's pain. You are the only one who experiences pain.
8/ You can either be intolerant of others or you can tolerate others.
7/ The first person to scream "I love you!" gets the attention that comes with the name.
6/ There is a bit of a saying you can't teach your mistakes. You can teach them.
5/ You can't shame. You can only shame.

3/ Be consistent.

Over the past couple of years, many authors and publishers have been giving a lot of attention in favor of the mobile/email model and making the Internet the place where authors put their books and reader experiences. It's becoming a powerful part of the Internet. There's always someone with a story and someone with an idea and they could text you that about.
You can then edit the text in your phone and send it back to the author

It is a classic case of starting with a goal and accomplishing it only when you feel it's a worthwhile limit   Scenario: You take the first deep breath of the day.  Now you think of email.   On a Monday morning.   You start typing.  Copy paste.   Your brain makes up the contents.  You go to Gmail.  When email arrives, you always click on it.   Now your actions take precedence.   Great.

When faced with a situation you don't like or can't solve, a balance must be struck.  Understand that it's normal for you to be frustrated, skeptical, or not clear about something.   Sometimes it's natural to avoid dealing with a problem.    If you can't deal with it or it doesn't get any better, tackle it yourself.

All of the self-help advice because it's so easy to get set up well for a good return.   But often there is a downside to self-help.

Start with an idea, refine it, sketch ideas, revise ideas, transcribe ideas, gather feedback. Focus on the five core qualities of founders.
Leadership is the ability to inspire followers  Make the best decisions, setting values and character,¬†continuing to innovate and grow, and listening to people.  This take-home is:  ‚Ä¢ No tenacity. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ‚Ä¢ Passion, no matter the situation. Failure to deliver is no reason to leave. ‚Ä¢ Creativity and unbridled enthusiasm are signals that you are who you spend your time‚Äã in. Others won't respect you. ‚Ä¢ Persistence is your passport to the world. You don't settle for hype. You stay the course.
Ask yourself: "How many ways can I change the world in one day?" You need to know if you can do it.
Celebrate success  Think about the difference you make every day. Start small. Maximize value. Pro tip: spend time with your family and friends doing the things you love. Take a hike with them. Connect with other people working in different fields? Invite them to join.
Instead of looking to the future, focus on the present. Return value to changes.  Take the embarrassment out of remaining in a fix.
Think outside the box. Look beyond the square.
Take it one step at a time.

From Minecraft Wiki

There are two main types of logs that give new players a feeling of accomplishment:

Progress reports . The first step from a Minecraft newsgroup is to create a log in a public forum. This ensures that your name will be textually and showroom-worthy. The first one is The Hurricane üëáüôèüèª.

Logs are different from newsgroups because the log is private.  Anything about a log is stored in a separate folder

The rules: *be unique in name

**the point of mining is to get better tools for the community.**

Real-Time Mining is a very simple concept. You set up your computer on the internet and begin watching a video (or log) every 30 seconds to determine a probability and move forward.

What does it look like?

The solution is to make it much more complicated:

What if I had a position in an online game? What if I had an account?

Real-time mining is difficult. Imagine when you were 10, playing UFO‚Ñ¢. Every subsequent hour or two you were getting closer to find it. But it was always an upgrade. Just 6 months later you were spinning your own wheels, and needed to move to better position.

It's that simple!

From Pinterest.     Well, I should probably pause my eccentric way of getting yourself famous and bland because when I first started Instagram I did not even have a page. I just wanted to get my friends to share their stories with me and my friends. Just like emotions.
Twitter. My shooters keep dying. I tried to look like an expert on Twitter. I tried to have a mental image of what my tweet should look like. But I'm just me.

Google (s goog) is struggling to fix the woes of its search algorithm, with the number of people using its results dropping as much as 10% a day.
Google has a problem.  It has bad, bad search results.  Perhaps worse, its bad search ranking system is starting to stick.
Google started improving its performance in the 1990s by identifying what you wanted to read.  The same thing is going to change these days.
The search algorithm is changing.  Google now knows what you want to read, but it doesn√≠t know how to provide it.  It doesn't need to create a separate page for it.
Ironically, if anyone can fix this, it is Google.  And they have the money.  In fact, there is an opportunity cost for anyone to assist Google.
Somehow, the search algorithm has become an online savvy hobbyist.  In 1992, Google started by helping people in the US locate information online.  Over the past few years, the search algorithm has evolved.
Google makes a successful promotional pitch and insists everyone read its blog posts.  The entire world watches web traffic trends.  People watch Google make money. 
If you want a better journey in life... don't blindly trust the current search algorithm.
Google has a way to help you find interesting, relevant and relevant content online.

Sir Alex Ferguson is a great man.

Too true.

Big picture: he is a leader, someone who aims and has accomplished more than anyone else in the game today.

Big picture: he lost the final two

Because people like him are rare.

So how does a great manager get caught up in the moment?

Simple.

He doesnt try.

He just‚Ä¶stays in bed and watches which channels his kids surf.

GIF credit: Kidseking.

Ferguson says some of his favorite things to people when invited to lunch at a restaurant.

Parks who laugh at his jokes.

Drinks at parties.

Pills he buys from a brother.

Courtships he dates.

A doctor he works for.

Points in games he plays.

Because a great manager is unique.

You could make this argument for any ‚Äì and it's obviously worth making if you were a good manager.

Abstract The human ability to experience pleasure has been influenced by several factors, two of which are social policies. For example, the feminists who argue that we should have a culture of pleasure are predisposed to think that pleasure is desired, but not genetically determined. They also tend to discount the value of the value of some emotions. In this chapter, we examine the psychometric properties of responses to positive and negative feedback in large samples of individuals. We probe the relationship between brain activity and the reward/pink-slip response, and we investigate whether moral decision-making is dominated by output from the Pleasure Network.

The title of this section is a play on words: People like to think they're the least bad.
Another thought: Most productivity tools don't help you get anywhere.   Most productivity tools aren't useful at all.
They looked at a wide range of productivity tools: Editors, Reviewers, Business Journalists, Content Writers, Product/Marketer Analysts, Backstage Executives.
Most of the tools were designed for attention seeking focused personalities.
More than half the tools were tailored for people who are NOT busy. Many of the tools only help you get where you want to go.
The result of focusing on tools is that you stop looking for "what should I be doing instead."
Our focus on tools is alcohol + sugar.

Hollywood.  It's still too early to tell if Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp will ultimately boost the app's rank. Could be great for Instagram. But how will Snapchat benefit?
Strengths:  - voice dictation and photo sharing   - built-in wall  - facebook friends-only  - watermark  - Instagram (reminders)   Weaknesses: - minimal native functionality - short battery life (3 hours) - steep learning curve  - not natively for iOS
Bottom Line:  - at a minimum, I think it'll boost the app's rank and offer some type of watermark to the app. - Facebook unfriend/unfriend friends will be a factor  - Facebook will have more incentive to add more Facebook-branded features - Facebook may trademark the app name - Facebook will circumvent Apple - Facebook is a lot faster - I think they'll be more aggressive in the next few months  - Facebook may throttle the app ranks more than they did WhatsApp   Comments welcome.
Happy Thanksgiving!   - when looking at these numbers:  - at least 1 billion users - around 1 million monthly active users - higher mix

Recently, I posted on VMware for MongoDB. After several more virtual machine blogs, I thought it would be interesting to benchmarked my philosophy at this point, and compare it to their .NET Containers.
I noticed a few things about VMware's leadership: ‚Äî  Don't take credit for others mistakes. They don't call others like they call themselves an MVP.  ‚Äî  Don't be held accountable for a failed performance. You don't blame the cloud for failing.  ‚Äî  Don't be held accountable for a failed thinking process. They never call you @VVVimperium.
Here are my thoughts on how VMware was and is going.  I've highlighted most of the important points above, with some context. And I've also highlighted the key takeaway points.

Or you learned enough you studied to pass an oral exam.   That's awesome.   Or you learned enough you taught a class, got a certificate, and studied for an exam.  Or you learned enough to become a professor.  Or you learned enough to get that working instructor role.   Those are all awesome.

Back in July of 2016, a little over a month before we started shipping the Q500, we were asked to enter into an agreement to acquire a majority stake in sales of a certain competitor's product, a product that never should have been part of our software product lineup. The subset of customers we acquired wasn't the best customer, but it was also not a vendor who could provide a triple-A product in a similar category. A few months later, to our surprise, we were able to inform Patel and our management that the price tag for the deal was that much higher than we had previously expected which, at best, my folks were happy with.
Taking a look at that purchase history tells us some great things. )at the time, we sold for $2M and made a profit. The price we were paying was only $30K or $130K, even though the product we were working on was worth closer to $5M.
In one year, we made a total of $6000 or so in profits for our company and for our employees. In two years, we made a total of $3000 or so. This trend was powerful. They might not have been the best customers, but they were the most loyal customers.

An Instagram employee says they don't censor people &amp; photos on the service.  The spinout of a Canadian tech company Ready+ is marketing an app that does just that.   Instagram Founder and COO, Kevin Systrom has created a threat to the wealthy with Instagram.   Twitter senior VP of Sales &amp; Mark Kern has presciently predicted the rise of social marketing.   At Aniolgos, we'm all ducks.  I've been eyeing this app for a while but haven't convinced myself that it's worth a punt.   So why not HDCP 1.0?

====================
Fake news is the most common form of fake information in our society, and it is changing rapidly. Many real companies are now shutting down content on fear of being labeled as "fake news," with BuzzFeed being the most prominent example. The stories we consume are becoming less objective, and more of a curated and filtered product.
Readers: How do I detect fake news?
The Internet may be a private means of communication, but purveyors of it share the same responsibility for the manipulation we see happening online. The last few weeks have been an example of what we are seeing.
Realize that the internet has reached a point where all information gets uploaded.
As we fight the illusion that our news is controlled by strangers and right wing commentators, we are wasting too much energy.

CONCORD, N.H. ‚Äî After an amazing start to 2017, the California Angels right-hander is dealing with soreness in his elbow.
It starts with his San Diego Padres, that's for sure. Entering yesterday, Aaron Harang tossed 6 1/3 innings with a 2.29 ERA. He's now just 5.2 innings shy of his career high. That's a tough streak to sustain.
Sergio Romo   The other day, my wife ‚Äî who is very good friends with the president, and a woman out there who can't even get a new flat tire ‚Äî said to me, "Man, do you want to talk to Romo?" So I thought about it in two months, and decided I'd never talk to him again.

The Wonders of the Holocaust
The idea of the Jewish Holocaust would be as unimaginable today as it was in the last few days of life.    I think it's because of the way we try to hide the history and not the backstory.  What does that say about us as a society?      http://t.co/m7PJXjNt
One of the biggest misconceptions about the Holocaust is that it was a genocide.   Genocide is what Hitler did to his people.   You can stay out the fight, but you can't stay out Jewish people.    The Jews are a proud people and understood the picayune meaning of genocide, offering their people "Gattatan" as one of the three elevations to heaven.    http://t.co/YcBjjnXR

The major difference between the Amazon Usability Model and the previous one is that we built this app in a new way. In the original model, we provided an API to a group of developers. We would send code to those developers to get to the ability to test and add functionality to the app.
We know that volume is secondary to cost.  We want to make it so that hearing what other developers are doing will add value for us.  More people means more buyers, more value for us.
The Mapa app has done battle with TV, newspaper, and book reviews.  The first thing Observer sees is someone does the TV review.  But to get more spins, we are feeding people the TV review.  For us, that is more valuable than volume.
The new model allows us to respond to people who are giving us feedback, not the volume of conversations we are talking in.
When I do this product, I often spend hours the first night buying many channels because I remember they are free.  That is a set back.
When you spend that many hours of investment, you realize that you are losing out on valuable sales.  The amount of hours you are spending is less than that of using a laptop. 
I built the first version of the Mapa app for free. Where it is today:   Their app is 80%

Influencing education is like eating a dose of dopamine. When you've taken it, you crave more.

Talented people know and believe what other people say, so they repeat it. Galileo had his theories repeated, and they echoed hundreds of years later.

Just because others say something doesn't mean it is real. Analogy works too. Everyone knows about Aleister Crowley, but the real Aleister Crowley didn't say much.

Critical thinking rarely succeeds. The only kind you want is driving people astray.

The most successful systems are complex, so they only stay sane when they can never be compromised.

When you maximize only the things you can do, your business is done.

Give as good as you get. Don't try to govern.

Don't set goals; always aim for excellence.

Don't praise people who achieve; let them fail.

Don't cry when someone succeeds; laugh when someone fails.

Don't give the impression you like everyone; you will be disappointed.

When you have the "good person" property, you attract the bad person. If you have the "bad person" property, then you attract a bunch of the good people.

Different of one to five. Depending on the context and motivation.

The goal here is to give people the sentence that you can return an instance of not just *some* type, but *all* types.

My darling pal @matthew_garcia is tweeting about a thread of baboons. This thread is possibly the best thread I've ever seen about baboons on the web.
A lovely German shepherd sits on an overturned tray of dinner at a flea market.   Sturdy wooden boats are piled on top of each other beside an overturned tray of sushi-type plates.   They sit in a circle, perfectly clumped, hour after hour.   I pick up the tray and step down immediately. It's true. I'm all stuffed.

A friend and I recently took a walk around town. We wanted to find out what the landmarks on our current itinerary were. It seemed to me the best way was to stop and see what landmarks we were approaching. So we took off walking back and forth, hoping to finish our marathon.

At the end of the day, social media is what we want to do. The degree to which you use it is how much you enjoy it. But don't be surprised if the majority of people are Facebookers.

Fake Facebook Profile

My friend and I both use Facebook occasionally. We go out of our way to be as honest as possible. In this post, we'll walk you through some tools you can use to impersonate someone on Facebook. And yes, we will go in chronological order.

I just wrote the first 50 articles of 2016. Those articles are something I want to write frequently. So, as I'm writing this article, I've made almost 1,000 articles and I feel they're sufficiently funny to share. Which makes my writing far bigger than before.

Here are a few of them:

A big part of being a good criminal lawyer is being non-judgmental while your client is in court.
First we try to do what everyone else is doing, which is flatter the target of the ad. People spend its money on lousy games instead.
If you can't evaluate risk, make your own.
We do a top down process to come up with ideas. It boils down to looking at the options, weighing the costs, and minimizing risks.
Logic gets in the way. When logic tells you you should do something, do it.
Give your intuition big freedom but allow it to speak for itself.  Your intuition is very powerful, but your thoughts are usually the only thing you have free.
As an attorney, I'm a fundraiser. I have a spreadsheet on my desk, marked up with every opportunity I could ever have. I take it with me everywhere.
Lots of lawyers are introverts, but many are extroverts.  The characteristics of introverts and extroverts will be important when rethinking your chances of a successful case.

@Lqaaa What type of simulations do you want to follow?  What interests you most?
The difference between a customer and an employee is:  One buys a practical product to sell and then changes its structure to match what the customer wants (team work)  This is the practice of customer acquisition.  Tech companies have to be wary of this.
@phug__ms Let's talk about payment for a minute.  What's the best way to make e-commerce a viable business?
The early stage investor must be at least strategic and will allow you some freedom.  This is something management teams often don't exhibit. A strategic investor wants to make sure that the entrepreneur gets everything he wants.   The correct model should allow for this.  A strategic investor as well as the strategic person have to allow the business to operate at a level that isn't high risk but requires some level of innovation.   These 2 attributes often go hand in hand.
What's one thing that doesn't work for a well-established company?   Would you rather a poorly able customer service person abandon your business because you were paying too much for a bad product or would you rather a well-shaped company be a badly shaped and hard to use product?

6. Identify Your Location First
The first choice is where you live.   Now, if you want to use CP, you have to spend some time looking for a place to try it.  So, I think it's amazing.   Any vacation spot or location will work best for CP.   If you live in California, you want to try CP there
The second choice is where you are looking.   Now, if you are looking to get CP for the first time, you have to get a good place to try it.   Again, CP is a great place to start looking for a vacation spot

"There is no service that can compete with a vacation ever. Now, you can be to rich as the sun." ~ Oprah

A fondness for riches has long been a central theme in the works of many writers. In his most famous tale, The Art of War, Tolstoy echoes the advice of his own son: don't be shortsighted.

Evaluating the Best Books of the Week:

To read this week's celebration: read one of my favorite books of the week: by @amyokhoushikhal, The Soul of a Co-worker by @ashleytype Some readers will find it difficult to digest, but for me, what it says about the state of the art in human behavior and the movement toward being indifferent to comments about job performance or poor behavior that I think is a key point of emphasis ‚Ä¶‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/bCZLITs5rq

Oliver Cromwell
Who is Oliver Cromwell?   Cromwell is a character in the plays of Shakespeare.   On June 28, 1726, Cromwell wrote the famous Proverbs.  It is said that he had a very simple still life, and this remains the only aspect of his life that stands with us.
Abraham Lincoln
Developing a Creativity Mind in the 21st Century   "You came in at the wrong time."  In an interview, Jonathan Franzen wrote:  "The best way to stay inspired is to be awake. Give it your all."  You, the reader, can give it your all.  Every day is the opportunity to do something valuable.  Make it valuable.
Proud of Your Success in Life, Well-Guarded Items   I give this quote to every single project I work on. The question my planner asks me?  "What is the one thing you keep to yourself?" Inspiration's endless, and you can start often.  This quote gives me more time for my work.
The Character of Oliver Cromwell   (1849, 9 June)   In my analysis of the Shakespearean play "Proverbs," I think I understand what seems almost too obvious.   Oliver wrote Proverbs twice. Remember what proverbs are about:  ‚Ä¢ ¬†¬†Double

Writing for customers: Arguing for the value of writing   My posts on writing for customers go into great detail on exactly how to reach these customers.   Here are some great startplaces:   - The Observer - ConversionXL   - Writing through Twitter and¬†engaging   - Numerically and In Depth   - Listening to podcasts
But no matter where you go, the best material for writing for customers jumps out.   I think this is because it's hard to judge why a product is important for a customer.   Removing that filter makes it harder to tell you're wrong about the value of a product.   If you publish your conclusions below, you'll see in a minute why I get it.

The Battle of The Big Booty vs. Johnny Forrest
Remarkably, Charles Barkley never won the first battle.  In March 1951, two years prior, during the second season of The Chuckle Brothers, my childhood hero, "The Big Booty" gained an obnoxious and cowardly reputation as an opportunist with no commitment.   In the game of chess, he goes up against a master.
The Big Booty vs. The Chipmunk
In ice skating, sometimes, you notice when you're down.   There is a story about the time I picked my nose while skating and sticking my nose in at the end of a long, long day.  I was at home on the hill, when my wife called out at me.  I thought she was a cop.

The Flaw

Some useless rules in "best practices" are the hallmarks of a fail. But in some cases, they are the hallmarks of a success. Please read those below.

The Flaw

You don't need to go to the bank every 30 days.

You should treat days by day as if you were losing weight when you lose. Become cautiously healthy

Your biggest mistakes are often your biggest strengths

You lose money by living in shoes.

No one can change you, just become the version of yourself that they want to see

The Flaw

You need to make certain decisions every day

When you're hyped up, you can play with anyone

You can't program time but you can program money

You can be excited about certain things but you can't be excited about others

The Flaw

Change machines get you what they want

Hyping is the glue that holds a library of ideas together

No one is your friend, you are truly an extra

The Flaw

Your decisions speed up the mechanism

leggings aren't the newest fashion

You have to be cautious when people talk to you

Your mentality is irrelevant. I am convinced that yes its not a good idea to talk to people who turn down a promotion

A: It's a lot different in other cities. It's a lot of different factors. And it's where a lot of the momentum doesn't go into the equation.
Q: What is the best subscription model?
A: I'll take ad-supported. Looking at the Bay Area, it's been really do-it-yourself. And it's where engagement has been really kind of a strength to the company. And I like the environment too. And I love the opportunity to be able to help it.
Q: How many people like Wikipedia?
A: I'd say it's basically 12-14 million people that are active on the platform. And people like Wikipedia. People like the freedom that comes when you can submit content.

DAVIES COUNTY, Fla. ‚Äî A Florida woman says she's whipped a diaper rash on her son last week after being unable to clean the rash clinically.Paula Jennings says she started feeling it between her legs and in her groin area. She says she took it in to see a doctor.Jeremiah says his leg twitches very often before 9pm. He told his mom he's always felt sick. Jennings says he usually lies about it.Last week Jeremiah woke up with a rash."He starts worrying more and more about it, like it's contagious, when it's not," says Jennings.The rash does not look like it's contagious, but that has left Jeremiah with a bad attitude."He's like "He's the one that's sick. He's the one that looks like he's going to die." I was worried about him."The rash involves his hands and feet and runs all the way to his stomach."I just couldn't handle this anymore."Jeremiah says he's thinking about suicide. Jennings wants him back in bed. They're calling it a day"He's not allowed out of bed," Jennings says."But I did tell him that you don't do that to other people."March 13th, 2017."I don't know what to do with myself."

I like to think it's because population growth is such that there is excess variance in phenotypes. Using more variation means you get more stability, I think. Again, that's how human nature works. In this case, more variation would mean you get more variation in the phenotype. The monozygotic Twins in replication did get a bit lucky, they still have a pair of indistinguishable twins. If that was a random effect, I'd have all of them screwed on.<|endoftext|>The owner of private meditation studio BuzzFeed has been convicted of potentially saving over a million people from using pills to control anxiety.

‚ÄãMatt Mullenweg, owner of the private meditation studio, has been found by a judge guilty of criminal contact to a minor for allegedly promoting a child pornography site.

Mullenweg appears in court in his Waltham company chef's uniform, wearing a distinctive gold band around his right eye and holding a petition for a pardon for the others. He does images of a seal emoji, with the name of the company's founder on a rickety wooden desk.

Grant Elliott, Assistant District Attorney for the Eastern District of Massachusetts, asked the judge if the defendant was able to articulate what he did for them. Although Mullenweg says no he did at least attempt to articulate what he did for all the people involved. Elliott then asked if the

My friend working towards a PhD and unstuck in his work.
I was born in Israel of Persian parents. At the age of 10 I had a trunk full of treasures.
That's partially because my dear friends and family had never seen me not worried. They were like "Oh well, I don't know what you're doing better."
This is why I admire people with "unconventional solutions." I spend my days correcting people for saying they can do what these folks can only dream of doing.

Over the past couple weeks, I have felt a tremendous level of energy in my life.  I have been inundated with questions.  I feel like I have been on the journey of discovery. 
However, in the last couple weeks, I have felt ill.  I feel like everything‚Ä¶ "feels" too short.  I feel like everything is becoming too expository.  I feel like too much information has been gathered and shared.  And I feel like it is weighing on me.
I am trying to find some balance between flowing and refraining.
I hear that if you want to give your best wishes, offer up something that happened to you.  So what happened in 2017 has largely fallen by the wayside, but 2017 is still worth revisiting.

Welcome to my smoke-filled lil' drink hour down under.  With my guest Linux Robby Mook and Lesley-Anne Neveau, hosts of Code.college and The Code Tea Room.
Last year I released the debut episode of Code.  I decided to put together an online panel show.  There are so many great panel shows out there.  But they don't typically cover primetime programming.  Frankly, having hosted the first one, it was something of a switch.

The state of gay rights in North Carolina has been in the news a lot recently. Chancellor Alvarez and Attorney General Cooper received enormous jeers for passing a bill to ban same-sex marriage. Ralph Northam easily defeated the hard-right governor and will now run for office.
Most people seem to assume that there is really no reason to be uncomfortable with others, and that being gay becomes comfortable in the society we live in.  Looking deep into history and biology, I want to realize that this is not true and that there are as many possible ways to be gay in the world.  By explicitly banning same-sex marriage in North Carolina you have fully broken with your history and bet that you think this disconnect between your brain and gut is not a big deal.  Imagine if you thought this was okay...
I feel like I've always been this way.  I grew up a complainer who believed it was wrong to be gay.  But as a little kid I thought that being gay was actually okay because I like what I wear and I don't mind if I'm judged.  But then I turned 30 and realized that any more realistic self-worth was based on others' evaluation of my pretty, pretty face.  I can't imagine being comfortable with someone in a sign language wheelchair or a blind man in front of me in a parking lot.  I do not wish

About a year ago Ashley Steel wrote about her experience with cancer. All I knew at the time was how I got cancer in the first place. I couldn't believe anyone could have cancer. Not even myself.
So I was inspired and did the Cancer Project for the 2nd time. The first one was relatively short though. This Friday I'm going down to South Park this weekend, thinking about all the years of my life before cancer.  https://t.co/YmRZGsxhce
2010 life: I got cancer.  I was 20. I read a book that taught me how to think the right way. I was diagnosed.  Reading that book didn't make me an optimist. It made me deterministic. I know it took some time. But when you do it for real, it never goes away.
Then cancer.  I was 18. I was going to college. I had just graduated as an MFA student! I became a writer. Toasted, chocolate chip cookies, $0.50 checks, eating rice. In 2010 I went to pick a fight with my email, phone, and laptop.
So, here I am. 2017.   My screen is been covered in photographs of what I want to be. I remember that yeah, I still had to get better. Those are what I want.

====================
Example code for calculating the Galleon valuation by the amount of money someone is willing to trade. The trading volume is less than one percent. A high price means the CM is willing to make large moves. A low price means the CM is not willing to make large moves. The second option is the CM is trying to minimize the risk of a loss. the higher the risk the more willing the CM is to make large moves. The third way to calculate the value of the CM is to focus on the deviation between the SF and the CM value. The deviation is the difference between the SF value and the CM value. The higher the difference the more willing the CM is to make big moves. As a rule of thumb, the tighter the FCF the more willing the CM is to make big moves. This is the rule which I believe describes the influencing force of price segmentation in the stock market.<|endoftext|>What is #TBD?

====================
Every producer should consider the following techniques to get their music in front of buyers:
a. Create an idea for a song with a completely different context than the rest of the song      - Get careful with new ideas. If you're trying to make it big, it makes sense to separate it from the rest of your music to gain exposure everyone else enjoys
b. Avoid clich√©d or formulaic lyrics that aren't true in the first place     - Avoid these lyrics entirely &nbsp; only produce songs with truth and little distortion
c. Be as explicit as possible with your lyrics - If you're trying to sound like a true artist, start with the basics   - Do not leave a single detail out, every detail is crucial for selling your music
d. Put as many lyrics as possible in two or more places in a single line    - Use long quotation marks to clarify your point and keep the listener on the journey. Avoid lyrics that introduce ideas that don't need to be explained
e.¬†- Put a strong  + sign upon your lyrics -  Go in as a man, do the work as a woman - Be sensitive to the feelings of your audience and avoid making them angry
f.  Make people laugh or cry even if it's uncomfortable - Don't fight the pain, make them laugh. No need to

I am a little late to the party when it comes to endorsements. As a love of celebrities and people, I crave them. But I choose not to recommend them. Maybe it's the burden of the legacy, the work they have done, the progression they have made, or the brand loyalty the person has. I don't know.  But I have it on good authority that, if I were a celebrity, I would not recommend them to others.

====================
Further, the Treasury always guarantees a fixed (not indexed) yield. Which means the interest rate it calculates looks like the market value of its instruments.
One can see when these instruments are actually performing. That's the point. There is no deliberate activity to reverse these moves for a server.
The cause of this is the control of what you write down - anything you stare at, or can't see unless you read it.
It's repeated over and over. It is just...normal
Equity investing is almost given away by this. You are told you can only invest in companies that have earnings that are positive. Which means they have low P/E ratios. Low capital, highly leveraged. Lack of scale. Low liquidity . In other words...risky stuff.
It's a child cheating. He is so caught up in the calendar of all things, he forgets to invest in stocks.
The trick is to say you don't drink. Until you do.
You can get rich playing with momentum, especially in sectors like healthcare. This makes you look like a hero.
If you sold equity in the health care industry the price falls in quarter 3. You can put it back into equity, and start over up. It's like a sunk cost strategy.
There is no liquidity problem. There is however a spike in liquidity on days like Valentine

Rabbi Yair Rosenberg, leader of the powerful but sometimes hyperbolic Jewish youth movement at UC Berkeley, released a newsletter for Jewish students this week called This Changes Everything: The Story of the Jewish Kids on Race. Yair reports from the "it" campus; here, listen:

Rabbi Rosenberg:

We're at 200 [sic] students on campus‚Ä¶ And, you know, we're talking about people not just at the "group think" sort of highschool level but people in their 30s.

What is it? Afrocentrism? Mixture? The time has come for us to advocate for real, structural changes.

The Jews of this generation: they're fed up with feeling like they're not labeled the same as these other races. At one point, when they were teenagers, no one wanted to label them as jews.

If they choose not to address their experiences with racism, the racism will continue to continue to escalate.

And when it comes to identity, they don't feel like they're just black or brown.

A quick one. When you want to see something more, you don't look at stuff by the watch price. You look at the ownership price.   Look at their dividend yield.  What you see is what when in Shanghai you look at a couple of stocks at the YTD and decide: "Yeah, I wish I had bought them a month ago." 
The biggest mistake you make is comparing apples to apples.  If you watch the price of 1 tech stock and it's at $10,000 and you are on the bubble of a tech bubble, you pay $100, and you're behind.  If you look at that performance, it looks like:  If you had bought the same stock at $10,000‚Ä¶basic rules of investing:  Buy more than it's worth.   Else‚Ä¶release.
If you look at the forecast for the next 10 years, you see what everybody has been talking about since 2003 and probably triple watch time.  Even Warren Buffett doesn't do that.   Two years later, you're on the market at $18,000. The price is at $17,000.  (Why not call it 9 out of 10?)  If you've been watching the stock price for 9 years, then you've become the market.

Ahead of its unveiling this week, the Huffington Post team decided it was in its best interest to resign its top editors.

One of the biggest "boomerang's" franchises of the last three years - virtual reality - is slated to debut at the end of 2013.

More than 125m immersive virtual reality (VR) headsets will appear on the market in 2012.

That took local journalist and virtual reality pioneer Bethany Colson by surprise.

Prior to the launch, Amazon announced that its Indian fulfilment centre would take financial responsibility for indian VR projects. The reason behind this is that with hundreds of millions of consumers online, the number of full-time jobs available is immense.

Two London schoolgirls last night got in touch with Twitter, which has decided that it will not class them as girls.

Gaby at Pontefract High School tweeted: "I'm gonna go shopping for a novel."

The message is something like this:

As quirky as their love for creativity is, we sometimes find ourselves scrambling to avoid it.<|endoftext|>BACKGROUND & AIM: The effect of caffeine (2-methylbutanol) on chronic tiredness or irritability is poorly studied.
PATIENTS: Seventeen healthy young men and women aged 18-40 y. Dose of caffeine (2-methylbutanol) consisted of 120 mg every other hour for 23 d.
INTERVENTION: Young men were instructed to drink 150 mg caffeinated coffee (9:00 AM) one coffee-time nadir, then drink 150 mg caffeine-syrups 200 mg every other hour, 2 h after consuming the stimulants.¬†           
RESULTS: Over 18 h it took 18 hrs to complete the caffeine intercept; 68 hrs to complete the latency intercept; 87 hrs to complete the continuation and return to baseline during the eighth half of the treatment, 9 hrs to complete the 90-day avoidance and return to baseline during the 90-day return to baseline.

Twitter is where the Community is making money off of their fans.  For instance, Axe's have a bunch of fans, but its usually their account, not their music.  If you guys are into video games, check out Steam.  If you're into hip hop, go check out EG. Not much sharing possible.

Athletes who struggle to make adjustments in their world are believed to be depressed. So the team gains a bit courage, and the team adds another. If they can collectively work through these differences, the team wins.


Now, if each of us were patient, we could regularly move from one place to another, even if it takes a while.


The Team Is No More Than a Munki

That's not how I would describe my principles.


You don't eat as much as you burn energy.

You quit more frequently than you exercise.

You stop participating in sports that have nothing to do with the most important thing at the center of your life.

You spend more time binge-watching television, than playing inside the game.

The more excuses you make, the more money you lose.

You stop feeling happy about what you've made and instead, feel bitter about what you've left behind.

You're always fighting the same fights. Doesn't that make you a loser?

You don't understand the human condition.

You feel like you have so much power, but because you are so seldom given that power, you participate in damage control instead.

You get angry with your partner and immediately take that person away.

You become consumed with the next big event.

Hillary Clinton's wild race to the White House has turned into a losing proposition.

Clinton's campaign is owed $700,000 from her 2010 federal filing. That's more than she made in October 2010.

How can the guy who makes $100,000 distill it down to $2200? Honestly, I'm surprised to see James Comey popped.

Hillary Clinton is now west of O'Hare in Chicago. Source: @pukixleo pic.twitter.com/l1DiwifzXM

Hillary, you can put out a mantra. It doesn't mean anything. The world still knows you don't believe in climate.

HOTS operates in a similar paradigm to the digital magazines described in Progress/Moore .  - You have easy access to topic-specific blogs your readers are consuming - Your audience theming is vastly underrated (often 50% is R&p and 50% is animation) - You have a large following of active members - You are free to create content and add to it
I think you'll find the @NYCDCaus space is about content creators, not creators. - As Kris Konbass wrote: "Internet viewership wants to be watchable, not all creators are spendthrifts."  - It's a very specific niche that you can dig into from this perspective

By default, resume price suggestions don't include a valuation by the size of your company. That's stupid. But to take the guesswork out you can create a price by the size of your company.  One way of doing this is to create a home-brewed value: value divided by size.   If your company is $2M/annually you get "2x worth of" value, $0.01/job for a ton of people.  If your company is $1M/annually you get this kind of value: 1X worth of "1X value".

The company was talking about how the company is changing.  As part of the growing Biz, the product was the analyst feedback.  One day it was coming in and the guy on the phone was saying, "Congressman, what's going on again?"  The stock went down and he was like, "Oh my god, what's happening here?"   This was the product we were working on. 
If you want to do it, convert:  a) a short position = high dilution b) medium position = low dilution   You want a targeted technical disruption in which your competitors are sitting in an opportunity of a lifetime.
We created more value for a while, but then, the pace of growth slowed.   It was a slow cycle of only a couple quarters.   Our B-segment continued to grow as well.   We were working on liquidity, but apparently long-term innovation was being somewhat stifled.   Why?  2 reasons ‚Äî not enough focus and spread of innovation.  And the positive was that the balance sheet grew in the process.

Shadowboxed#57: Isaac Asimov on Heuristics and Memory<|endoftext|>The state of Ohio is out of gas.

According to our latest Ohio Energy Gazette analysis, we are at one of the highest levels of uncertainty among each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

The economy has been in a bit of a boomerang this year, and uncertainty about the next presidential election is one of the biggest drivers there.

50 U.S. States

One of the biggest debates in politics today isn't why people vote. It's why they don't vote.

Not voting means choosing them over doing what Donald Trump has done in the past. It means believing all the possible outcomes, and doing the opposite.

This is why Donald Trump has been so successful. Trump is consistently wrong and getting you to believe more of his words.

It also means that if the end of the world came in 2016, and all the other outcomes were Donald Trump making you believe he was right, you'd pick Hillary.

It's historically dangerous to pick a party during the election, and especially if you're not sure you'd stick with it. As a result your kicking yourself if you choose the wrong race and don't start slowly.

Ohio has one of the largest percentages of Democrats in the country, and the Democrats have one

You might have read for the first time in New York this morning that an incredibly interesting meeting took place between Tayyip Erdogan and Donald Trump, which seemed very de-escalating from the beginning. Although he isn't really a threat to anyone from Turkey; and it seems like he probably doesn't want to be but he is perceived as a very dangerous man in Turkey.
While there are likely many things that worsen with time, this may not be one of them.
The present is unstable. However, it is more stable than most people think. You also have to look at the future. It is writing the Sunday paper. However, I'm writing about how some things may go wrong in the future, I think this is strongly correlated to the thoughts you have about the future, like when it is cloudy or putting too much value on time (shareholding)

This caused lots of 'chaffing' among many people. Everyone is a volition, snap judgmental body.  I mean really?   the body knows it's not supposed to do what the head tells it, it's supposed to do what's left to it.
Think carefully about what you destroy.  ¬†You're making the world go away.   At the same time, you're creating more opportunities for people to get by.  For example, if you stop killing, do you let resources go to waste?

This is an important message to share. I would like to talk about living the life that was meant for someone else.   Annnnnd,  My practice of family and friends is starting to resemble a career.

The battle for real estate is still in its infancy. Today, the sole lesser-known player is China Capital Group Ltd., Previously known as Wanxiang Holding Co., or Wenchuan Capital Limited.

Jiaotong Capital Ltd is another $11 billion invested in mid-sized Chinese companies. Why the disconnect?
The $10 billion China Capital is valuing its stocks over recent years. The $11 billion Wanxiang is looking to acquire Chinese internet businesses. It does not take a rocket scientist to identify the odds of this happening

Domestic violent predators are a lot more disturbing than the everyday predators we indulge in, know and love.    They are the ones who are most likely to create and maintain extreme situations where they are the victims.   The non-violent predator doesn't usually know how to resolve these situations. The only way to solve runaway children is to <em>shoot them</em> into the crowd.   Domestically violent predators don't show it and they act like victim.   To be on their good side, the non-violent predator is a psychiatrist: a person who can tell if the situation is going to explode, cause a disaster or lead to a solution.   A tulpa is a psychiatrist.  The non-violent predator is a tulpa of a psychiatrist, such as myself. 
The trigger for likeminded human beings is currently known as a situation where they compromise with others to find a solution to the situation.   This phenomenon has been researched to date as the mid-40's.   The long-term solution is 90% of the time.

For me, one of the most interesting advances in the science of representation has come from researchers using art into the testing of a hypothesis. We see it in the evasive ways Hollywood uses props and memes; we see it in the way filmmakers try to market their films through the same commercials. But for me it's even more where the films go in‚Ä¶For this particular experiment it was decided to test a fake sci-fi movie called "Serenity," and I'll be honest: It was pretty boring. Not that we have anything to say about it. First of all, we're not 100% sure that it's real. Second, it's too early to say that it's a flop since it's being promoted by such shady interests. And lastly, we're not 100% sure the movie was meant to be a parody‚Ä¶ So, there are a lot of weird entanglement that needs to be worked out for this one to succeed.

Humans reduce fear and anger through the Congress system. But it is also full of blinders. Perversely, the more blinders one has, the more they are willing to take.

Yet this blindingly obvious and devastating fact is largely ignored in classrooms.

The story that I developed as a sophomore student at Northwestern University continues to inform nearly all of my writing activities. I learned early on that plenty of research with real-world data is pointless unless you analyze the data series and bases it on real-world values.

The most successful strategies encourage real-world learning and therefore constrain the amount of work we do or the difficulties we can overcome.

Think of the easy choices like "I can't do that" or "This makes me angry." They never lead to real work or thoughts that unleash growth.

Instead, they lead to the accumulation of knowledge that is impossible or prohibitively expensive.

The only way to overcome these structural ideas of achievement and success, is to ignore them. The answer, of course, is replicating fascinating real-world data in order to make better decisions. It's our way of becoming a better human.

This work and the work of others explain why 95% students in my course over 6 months make fewer decisions than they should after always tackling

What to do if you're in a relationship that is getting weaker and failing to live up to its potential? What to do if you're in a relationship that's made it into marriage but feels uneasy about the prospect of a family? These are closer to life-altering questions than they're often made out to be. And to be fair, they are. Sometimes you've just got to step away. And usually you can't. But if you do, there's a chance you could get a shot to rethink important aspects of your relationship.
I realize this may sound impossible. But I think it's a relatively easy test to pass . This is a test you should give yourself. If you resist doing it, don't worry. It's quite easy. There are three ways you can pass: Advantage, escape, and turnkey . If you can cut out the advantages and turnkeys, you are in the clear.  And if you can cut out those in which you worry and those in which you're deficient, you're doing it in the wrong direction.

The (highly) over-valued banks are valued too high, says Ms Cooper.

The final frontier of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is the "virtual maybes," where an idea is simply presented in the form of a hypothetical. The theory of ideas is not a simple one. Ideas are not static private objects; they can be electronically transmitted and change. Over time, ideas become integrated with those of the users and they eventually become realizable. Heisenberg was a pioneer in this, which encouraged the use of technology in the service of the field of ideas.
Heisenberg didn't just tell his students ideas (that is, the heuristic, which is the idea or idea-based heuristic) but also the way they could think.  Purpose becomes more effective if you have a clear, central idea to convey.     Here are seven of his best analogies to understand what he was trying to say.   1. Mathematics + (Original) Thinking  My favorite part of this is the idea of his that mathematics is essentially a search for a lens through which all the ideas are added.   This means you are trying to find the central idea that answers all the questions.   You pick a lens through which all the ideas can be added.    1.  An idea is a lens through which the world of ideas is put into perspective.   In a nutshell, the ideas of this book are:

Q: No one says 'but' or 'well' like I have.  A: Unlike an average Joe right?¬† No, you have more of an insight into what you're dealing with than he could ever conceive of.

====================
What are you reading?
The reasons we read are complex, time-consuming, and chaotic. We don't always understand why we pick books, we don't always read together, or we don't always read together.
Reading is a three-way relationship: separating the reasons behind the books from the reasons behind the practice.
The reason we read isn't the product of the process, it's the result of the process. If reading is only a product of the process, we'd be wasting time.
The process of reading primarily works against the genius exception. One way to counteract its effect is to make the process less creative.
Why we read online is a dialogue that arises from context (1)
The reason why we read is a combination of how we learn, (2)
The difference between reading research and reading is hard to see, but the effects cast a lot of doubt.
What can we learn from the Origin of Species? I think one of the most important lessons for those studying evolution is that we learn about evolution from writing about it.

But if there's one thing that is clear, it's that eliminating favoritism is a pretty damn risky proposition. Ease of doing favors for others/stranded clients or something.
The idea that it's easier to always be better than others is very dangerous.
Exacerbated by the fact that many of us haven't put in the effort to adapt to changing circumstances.
We struggle so much on the tech side that even some of our biggest advancements seem simple.
Good for suggestions and insight from others, but you need to be able to read and analyze other people's insights.
This all needs to change.

For example, as smart as Google is, when it comes to tracking the state of AAPL, you could be facing up to 100% performance per share losses through 2021.
Smart teams need to explore multiple solutions for a team effort. Sometimes it's easier to spend time on things we know will work.
Companies are so focused on their bottom line that they don't realize that performance is a function of execution. They focus on execution, but don't plan for execution.
The right team of people helps manage everyone's expectations. Some people increase workload in the morning, put anyone away, and let everyone relax in the afternoon. Some people cut back on office atmosphere, incrementally improve the environment, and relax when they get back to work.
A good team is one that:
‚Ä¢ Are willing to put themselves in difficult, upcoming situations ‚Ä¢ Are willing to risk their careers for little to no reward ‚Ä¢ Are willing to

If you are looking for the BEST pizza in the city you can't go wrong with Located in the heart of Chinatown you'll not be disappointed. Not only do you get a quality pizza but the Italian food is also incredible. Great tasting food.
Hands down the best pizza in the city. 4 stars because it's worth every second of it. Will not be returning. If you need a margarita then go for it. Commie.
Very good pizza with a lot of young people and families playing in the trees. Love it.
I mean, how many times have we all wanted pizza but have never had one? I'm shocked we got a 2 star review here... to be fair, I didn't actually order pizza, just a sandwich ordered using the map. But such a shame because the pizza was amazing.
Yummy! What a mornin', love it. Actually, I think that's how the 4 stars did not register. My date always takes money out at 1am, which I'm sure is why I got a 2 for it.

The path to therapy includes: an idea, a suggestion, and a letting go process.  What we ask in the beginning is reflected in the end. The quality of what we have to give up.  Getting things done matters more than what you give yourself.  The question to ask yourself is really this: What do I now stand to gain by giving up what I already have?  You can see the outcome of this by seeing the movement of your money over time.
The difference between an idea and a suggestion:   1: An idea is something you have an opinion about, the best advice you can give on how to make use of, you want to be influenced, and you dont like the results.   At the very worst, you think: is this really worth it to stick with my current plans, only to realize, no luck
2: An idea might be the closest thing you have that someone will have an opinion on or respond positively to.   That is considered to be the closest thing to perfect.   However, it's a close thing.   And guess what, they will have an opinion because they don't come up with it themselves in the first place.   (1: An idea)

I should note that I am using two axes.   Typical is a vertical one, for easy reading and merging.   And the horizontal one is a compass.  And there's a closed helical funnel.   Here would be the workflow / changes so far.
#2. Identify One Core Idea   With one clear idea, driver for network feels so much more like a network and it feels like network is a fluid thing.     In reality, it's just so much flow.   And it has only one core idea.   That core idea guarantees flow.
#1. In a 24 hour period, take an explorer's approach to discovery and discover a core idea that flows.    Bad ideas then become ones that fade away.   They fade away because they're not essential to a product.    Then, once they fade, information flows, and the user knows more, they much prefer it.
For a reference, here's what I'm working on right now:
#3. Build support for core ideas
Only product that allows you to uncover the core idea is 1

As the consumer of the internet, it is paramount for us to understand that not everything that we are consuming is a press release.

Merchants are printing ads to lure customers. When we interact with them, we easily inadvertently give them the knowledge that it is the "Official" THINK¬Æ App of the week. They are willing to pay for a feature they find distasteful.

1. Anatomy of Discontent.
By @simonburke
If you spend as much time online as I do, you're probably an "abuser" of one of the following, depending on your perspective:
I'm a social person. I pay attention to other people's reactions.
I have an opinion.
I don't care about you.
BENJAMIN TITELLE/FRIENDSHIP ANDL MALICIA/AFRICANERIA BCE
Having an opinion:   A negative first impression causes a negative impression later.
‚óäPeople who hug often hug strangers. People who hug often think they're helping others.
‚óäPeople who hug often talk about themselves. They keep quiet for the emotional safety of family.
‚óäPeople who hug often say they love you.  They're afraid they wonder what they might say.
‚óäHonesty is always about how you say it.
‚óäPeople who hug don't miss the arc of the universe.  Ordinarily, you feel better a few moments after you remember.
‚óäPeople who hug in public don't miss the arbitrariness of the moment.
If you have an attention deficit disorder, these five reasons will jump out:
1. You're heading in the wrong direction.

@sweezonthefood! We'll see you next week.
I think behavioral economics is finally winning in the criminal justice system. As a society, we treat criminal activity as a disorder, treating it like some kind of innate, disease we just have to face. That's bad for individuals and bad for society. Criminals don't just slip up and go back to school. Individuals typically do a lot more than schoolwork.

Three questions to ask yourself about Netflix on average per month :  1. What can I do this week? 2. What can I do this week? 3. What can I do next?  4. What can I do next?     It's easy to "go to the movies" or to "watch the super-heavy/dangerous movies again".   We shouldn't be too cool with that.  If you can't do it all, you're not doing it right.
#1: If you can do it all you're doing it right. If you can only do the right thing a few times a month it's easy in the long run to fall victim to situational lethargy. @Sven__Mohns   If you can focus on the right things you show up at the top of the list.  If you can only do one thing for a few weeks you are holding yourself back.
#2: Time distribution matters too. The same process applies to as well. Time is your enemy. Define risk and reward for yourself and block out the rest.  You get a lot more out of a plan like this than you do the last one.
#3: there are two ways to be weak. You can either be weak or you can be brilliant.  The real decision is between wanting to be weak

How often do you work on your blog? If/when? Where do you eat and drink? How old are you?

That blog post was almost never read by audiophiles!  Now I don't need to sit there and worry about how my podcast sounds as much as I could help.

"The only way that can work is if everyone agrees to cherish everyone else" is the mantra I try to repeat to anyone who asks me what my secret is.

I'm not trying to turn the world into a "sold" space ‚Äì the idea of doing something takes a fire in it, and you have to give it plenty of time to blow away.

We expect people to think deeply and it is amazing how they hyperevaluate things trying to see them through their narrow vision‚Äîand taking the opposite of what they meant¬†to say and think in their narrow vision.

1. How Uber became a free-for-all

At Uber, we value privacy. AT&T's Telefraternity data privacy problems make the company seem even more interested in collecting, processing, and selling our data. We also saw the botnet problem at Airbnb, so we were acutely aware that other companies didn't care what we feared about fake friends.

By Andy Poulin
Best Practices:  1. Identify a set of top-tier leaders  2. Find a community to help forge a common goal  3. Make a proposal for improvement - Think community building, district school board, or other institutional organization  4. Intelligently select the most relevant members to engage in the brainstorming  5. Post the proposal online, delivering it to everyone who will accept it - Are you selecting the most relevant members to initiate this dialogue?  Is your proposal reflective of anyone that you think would be willing to participate?

undergraduate, graduate, or associate degree students may only enroll in the program of study offered through an online university (unless the program of study is a degree programme). The College of Engineering and Knowledge Operations University offers students two different types of programs:

programme of study: The bachelor's of science requirement for the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Engineering allows students to complete two years of work in collaboration with a professional businessman. students are required to spend at least one year serving clients of the firm. If interested, send application and CV (into the enrollment system)

programme of study: The bachelor's of science requirement for the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Information Technology allows students to complete two years of work in collaborative development. students usually need to be in a business school, CUNY, or other College of Engineering. If interested, send application and CV (into the enrollment system)

Programmes of study may be combined and entered into the program of study. If enrolled in one of these two programs, no requirement works.

United States District Judge George Daniels, who is presiding over the lawsuit against the Trump Organization, says he cannot rule on whether the president violated the emoluments clause. (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, AP)

A federal District Court judge who is presiding over a lawsuit dragged out by President Donald Trump is having trouble deciding whether the president broke the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution by accepting payments from foreign countries that use the chief executive's seat to move Washington.

Washington's chief executive has been high-fiving and joking about the likes of British Prime Minister Theresa May on his yacht, texts and taunts with his daughter. President Trump has refused to call a special session. The Senate has refused to hold a vote on his ban on travel to and from the United States. Leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia have invited him to their countries.

Theodore Roosevelt said, "Wear a shirt and tie. Pleasure in life is superficial." The president you see in photos sweating and drunk in the Oval Office is also a figure to be admired. Working from his customized Air Force 1, he calls in sick at least once a week but refuses to drink or smoke while at the White House. He has no reason to go to bed sick.

In 2007, Bensinger & Co. created a 9000-word smart contract called YOLO. The spec is simple: let a shareholder add a power of 5,000 to each of their shares. When that's done, they return 90% of it after taxes and distribution.
But the idea behind Bensinger & Co. in 2007 was that 100% of your shareholding would be payable instantly. Profit margins would be astronomical, margins would be messy.
This is so wrong. Someone needs to solve this.
Full disclosure: I've donated to Bensinger & Co. every year for the last 20 years.  (2013 donation was $4,000.)

A reflection on how I created 1,000 digital manuals from 40,000 images
Hi,   I created 1,000 digital manuals from 40,000 images last week.   I wanted to share the process and merge it with the new digital tools.   How do I do that?
After struggling on creating enough content to become a full-time blogger, I decided I needed to create meaningful content.  I made the decision to create 100 blog posts a week.   I used G+ to create them (if you find it useful, share it).   Learned a lot, and realized that there were some good reasons to create content.

My mom needed help to finish cutting their nails and tried introducing me to the house mama. My dad was kinda surprised.
In 1992, I was a 15 year old freshman in high school, and my mom was buying a painting.  She bought it $10, then SOLD it to my mom for $50.  I remember asking how it was she could sell it for that much money.  Her response: "The best thing is, it's not expensive. Let's cut it."   I was just a kid with my parents.  Once I realized this was true, I realized that figuring out how to maximize the value of my purchases was a different game from people like my dad.
The good news:  9 out of 10 people are wrong
People rave about swiping card games.

ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) ‚Äì Lorraine Gibson, who lost her husband after being stabbed in the head, is on a quest to find justice. She says her husband was stabbed by his ex-wife after she was caught shoplifting.

Gibson wants justice for herself, her children, their daughters.

Gibson says the only way to solve this case is if a judge, jury and executioner sign off on execution. Gibson, 53 told reporters she is prepared to go to jail, if the State gets to hang her husband.

Gibson says she wants justice for her husband, but the only way to get it is by forcing a jury.

Gibson says it's unforgivable to put innocent people in jail for crimes they did not commit.

Gibson will be executed today.

Gibson has been convicted of 12 acts, which includes robbing a convenience store, breaking into a bank and committing a violent crime against a mentally ill person.

She says they should have committed her to incinerator 2,000 years ago.

Gibson, when asked if she was okay, said she is well, and was in the hospital.

Solarized Water in New Yorkers' Homes
Solarized water is good for your health, smell, and taste.   It's making NYC.  Your kids will agree too.
How Solar Water Cleans Teeth  ¬†Solarized water is a natural source of   minerals, carbonates and lime.   It's good for your children's teeth.   You can just add water from the tap.   If you have signs of decay, make sure you change it.
10 Scams and Reflections on Solarized Water   Tons of things can go wrong with solarized water, but these 10 do not:  1. Cold water 2. A new appliance 3. A new dishwasher 4. Use  diluted  in  your kitchen  5 . Own a radio when not in use.  6. Over time, bad things that happen to them upgrade - and better ones come in.

Anybody who has tried to avoid it is going to be disappointed. But even when you do give in to temptation, you will face the temptation of better alternatives.
@brandonr182 You've got individual responsibility, right?
@brandonr182 I don't agree. But I think you're a firm believer that the better you are at taking accountability, the better off you are. Your mission is to avoid failure.
The good news is: Life is much tougher than you might think. Take the LSAT writing this, Man.
@brandonr182 If you can't memorize and remember, you should probably quit. But now you're a master of other people's mistakes. It's not because you're a great writer. It's because you're a genius.
If every time I look in the mirror, it looks like my own reflection, I hate that ceiling.
Trying to avoid failure is like trying to dodge a bullet.
It's just not worth it. You have to do something. Or fail. Or give up and find yourself in the next situation.
@eddygey @brandonr182 I think there's another method. I've been saying that for 25 years, but nothing has changed.
@brandonr182 It's true. You gotta be balanced. Try to do it everyday.

This is a full guide for all Pok√©mon GO quests, advantages, and disadvantages.

WARNING: This guide isn't rated. Feel free to add your own, but this is not appropriate for children. This is a guide for an adult looking to beat GPS as I know how. (and not user friend limit)

1. Encounter existing/competing trainers

At the beginning of the introductory quest, find a rival active trainer. For ready to battle purposes, create an aspiring close friend and see what they are up to.

Make sure to recruit the player he or she wants to improve/do more. Reward the team they want to join, and make it clear they have a free ride to the top of Pok√©mon GO with active party members.

Don't recruit someone because they're a friend or they're the best player.They're both useful: recruit the most trustworthy and the most loyal.

Find the competitor to train with and make sure they're clean in Public/Running Trash. Make sure to earn positive karma with them so they're sympathetic/excited to recruit new players/friends.

Try 3 times:

trainers: "I'll join an active competitor in this quest to earn daily marks, and in return I'll gain 50% bonus mark"

lineups: "I will

CALGARY ‚Äî The northern B.C. community of the same name is experiencing a kind of migration.
It's a popular offer: it gives parents daughter-in-law status and, for some, child-in-law status if they grow old enough to join.
"Everyone is excited and kids are curious so they want to start families there," said Earl Hattie, head of the Peace Hill Elementary children's christening party.
One of the first places to announce the deal was the Facebook group.
Since the flurry of activity starting about two weeks ago, there has been an average of four calls a month with new folks looking at the Bishop and Paint Creek area. ( Ben Kuril/THE CANADIAN PRESS )
About 200 families have signed up to join them, said Hattie. More families will be added when all of the Couch Centre properties are up.
They are looking to expand more areas in Calgary and not necessarily close in on they house at Peace Hill Elementary in Bishopville.
Counting how many parents signed up, new families are joining and sharing their desire to paint carvings in the neighbourhood (which is ridiculous because there are no buildings) and go to weddings at the church.
Coffee cruises said there are four offers lined up with the first real chance to join. One is just like the other two with

Entrepreneurs stand to benefit from this. Google is offering a suite of quality investments that will be highly valuable in the future.
What is the importance of this? If you don't own anything at the moment, this means no potential growth in your online businesses, just a low price point.
I think this is the biggest opportunity you can find at this point of Google's history.

Love how comfortable a guy like Collin was in his hair. He's probably spent more time than he cares to admit hanging things. He'd win all the Oscar's, take 10k selfies with his winnings, keep his phone in one of the pockets, be by himself in the driving seat, etc.   He spent years developing the Phrases of Art, and unfortunately it turns out it's a shit-show (much) of a product.   As a result, he's created something useless that drives no traffic, only traffic to a location.  * Chances of being entertained - now this is interesting!!   Paying for this makes me uncomfortable.   I want to promote someone who doesn't have this problem.  Yes, I'd like to host ArmofBalloons games and/or DARC presentations.  Unfortunately, I'm so far removed from the folks I want to attract that it's not going to happen for me.   That's why I'm putting him on Hold to set this straight.  When will you take action?

So, I'm working on a different espresso machine. While I had a high end espresso machine for a couple years, I decided that the yaesu size just wasn't for me. I found the Lima was the perfect opportunity.   The Lima is a great machine. It's got a great flavor and build quality.  I'm not too sure about the reservoir though. I feel safe with using less air, I just have a worse time running it up and down the line.  I'm going to check out the yatesu again and see if this is the same machine.

About

TWO: The Last Question, by Alpha Polite, is a refreshingly complex read for first-time college dropout and weirdos alike. Karl Popper famously described TWONE as "the last question" and I think that's quite accurate.

Twice has given me some truly high marks. Both Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr. are fascinating to read. The book is a meditation on modernity and modern defeat.

Befitting a truly unique and thoughtful account of our time, TWONE is #1 on the Amazon bestseller list. Check it out.

#2 on @omniture. Impressive title, A #SuperAuthor in Austin. #PubHeal in mind?

#1 on Amazon. Pick it up.

This is an early, pilot book that I want to share with readers here in the US. I want to make TWONE available here in the States.

Say hello to the future! I think this one is pretty cool.

The Third Law of Multiplication explains how to make a 17x3$ profit on stock.

But what if we apply it to real estate?

Money can make a fissionable isotope explode.

The practical application of this to unexpected events is at the heart of the 300 Days of Nightmare series.

Can you think of anything more useful than using this technique correctly?

Have you ever decided that you want to apply the formula for establishing our independence to the bulk of your business?

We live in a world of ever-increasing complexity. It's easy to get overwhelmed by it.

The Truth is Much More Comprehensive than Most People Landscape Myths.

You may occasionally hear eloquent speakers brag about how they were forced to apply the formula for establishing our independence to their business at a minimum, and often resort to it just to avoid taking a mathematical risk. The difference between this and a casual application of the formula is that the latter has a greater penalty.

This applies for clever situations as well as simple ones.

Okay, now what have we learned?

Horizon Capital, the private equity firm headed by Paul Tudor Jones, has raised around ¬•8bn from investors including Tiger Global and the Bergdorf Goodman family.   The deal will result in a 325% return for Horizon over the next 10 years.   It comes as no surprise to learn that Paul Tudor Jones is the son of investment banker Paul Tudor Jones.   Horizon's last deal was with Tiger Global in 2012.

Privately known as a propaganda tool, YouTube is arguably the biggest name product in Silicon Valley. In 2013, the company had $50 billion in revenue back-and-forth with Google, Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Netflix (NFLX). What both the consumer and the internet companies are trying to do is create a fresh new product and dramatically improve the lives of consumers in the process.
Whether you like it or not, YouTube is the replacement for Facebook. As social media is king, YouTube is easily the king of social.
By creating a Facebook-like social platform like Facebook, YouTube hopes:
¬∑ Creating a new demographic group. Consumers who check out the content they'd post wouldn't rate it.
¬∑ The maker product. Specifically, creators and content creators will have a setup they like, and content creators could release original content with a 'make believe' style
¬∑ Creators that are passionate about their brand, could create creative content with low-rent price points
¬∑ Creators 'bunch' - creators from all over the world developing new content.
¬∑ The accumulated earnings would be used for a funding round to fund content creation.
What a great idea. I think we need to live and breathe this one.

Ask a web designer or social media expert what they watch on Netflix and you have a tough time detecting the bias. You're constantly asking yourself one question and accepting that it likely surprises you more than it should.


Little do web designers know, Netflix is the training ground, sandbox, and haven for most online content.

This is no joke. Netflix connects our help desk. It's the first place that we get a mobile development platform's thoughts and feedback right after they successfully launch a new application.

After showing me the amazing water effect it was time to move on to the baking.


I applied olive oil, butter, and my favorite fruit 'blueberries'. When I first started the water got all gritty and rancid. After applying butter and cream to remove it I was satisfied.


I followed the recipe exactly. Perfectly seared and then added red and green veggies. Also I fried the veg on the barbecue either side. Pretty damn good.


After the carrots I added the chocolate chunk and carrots. Then I added the strawberries. There's so much flavor. Tastes good man!

This was more subdued than I expected. I am partial to the black figs. Sweet and tart. If I could do it over again I would have added sweet potatoes.

This was delicious. The marinade is fantastic. I wouldn't have had the trouble to pull them out and roast. The sweetness was wonderful and the steak was nicely done.

The relationship between SCOTTY and the arts is a fitting metaphor for the much larger conversation we are having in Toronto right now.   The other day, I was lamenting how strangely I've never heard of a hipster/trend icon, and how many people don't know who named themselves after this or that.   While I've been at Massey College, I spent a bit of time with SCOTTY, observing his "wisdom from the outside". Take away his cryptic "son-in-law should first ask SCOTTY" and what do we stand for in Toronto?

People are still saying he's the best guitar player. Im not so sure. He had some dude play him a song on stage who had 12 songwriting credits. He has a HUGE personality, which makes him an ideal face for "The Best Show on TV". BAM! He is going to get you to show up, no questions asked. This event is going to be RM 95 for 1 hour.

It's 8:30pm and I'm at a bar. I've lost myself with my friends. I wander into a gentlemen's club wearing a Cosmo T-shirt. My friend introduces himself. The bartender goes off on the next order. I'm so drunk it took me shitfaced to order. I fucking lose control. It's 8:30p.m..
I've worked hard for a long time and I can't even feel something making me happy. I'm feeling insane and numb. There's a window of time through the thoughts that I have. The others can call and say bye-bye. I'm saying bye bye. I should be falling asleep.
I feel like I'm losing myself and I'm not sure where I am. I need some time to myself. I need to breathe.
I've depersonalized. I'm no longer in the same place. The goal is to get to a space where I can feel relaxed.
After this cyclical period of under control, I'm in the zone. I'm feeling blue, awake, healthy and have a good time.
I've thought about this a lot. I'm an island. Anyone can fall off an island. The only way to avoid falling off an island is to stay in the zone. I know that next time isn't going to be so easy.

The human brain's change detector

The human brain is a fascinating creature.  It's an amazing actor at making various inputs into the action you're in.  And it's a brilliant performer at tracking that action down the right course of action.  The human brain is an able producer of much information, and information flows like a stream.

Often what we think of as sensitive people, like checking their email, are not.  Because they are constantly, silently considering one thing: how to respond.

This is the difference between saying no to a doctor and saying yes to a date.  No one wants to clock in sick and listen to poison ivy and sonogram them every 15 minutes.  But they don't always need to.  And that's the difference with people ‚Äî there is the easy answer to stay on know with just one question, and all the complexity.

The mind is a giant visualizer about the world.   It sees itself in many, many faces, but in very few, many "faces" and not really thinking about them in a single heuristic way.  Everything in it is in motion.

What sets the human mind apart from other animals is a very open mind.  They don't want to make rules, they want to see it.  They expect stimulation. 

This means they are

The difference between a friendship and an interest is how much it people want to let you know.

If you're of high quality, you will attract people worth hanging in your life. If you're getting stuff from other people in a professional space, you might not want to.

Creativity is defined by an interest in great work.

Personal Finance and Wealth is an excellent book on this.

What does it mean to a friend to not talk about themselves endlessly?

The threats came in a Facebook post just a day after the professor was attacked by a student, while in another Facebook post after himself attacked another student.

Rutgers was rocked at the beginning of February by a series of bombs at the campus coffee shop

The New York Post describes the "shocking" developments as follows:

State University New Brunswick Police are investigating a Saturday attack on a campus coffee shop in which an assault suspect arrived with a pistol.

According to The Post, the suspect armed with a Glock 19 said "Go back to war" and started shooting.

Two people were injured in the assault, including a tramp who was shot in the arm.

The assaults were shared on social media sites including Facebook, Reddit.com and Twitter. The accounts had close to 500,000 followers.

Whichever way you look at it, the fate of foreign companies and their coworkers is likely an open question.
A few thoughts:  * Buy either a paper stock or a bond ETF.  Iloo's CFAE (NYSE: CFAE) didn't trade very well at the start of the year, but the index has almost completely rebounded.   Rating K-15 companies has historically improved as stocks go up.   Yields on 50-year bonds and 10-year Treasuries have both improved, or should we say stabilized.   This is the first time since the Great Financial Crisis the way forward is positive.   The value of ordinary as well as muni-bond (non-commodity) US Treasury bonds has actually stabilized.  * Invest in the Silicon Valley Trucking Company.  It's listed on a myriad of exchanges, and I do it as a regular exercise.   Btw, it's worth $25 billion.  * Avoid the Southwest Airlines (NASDAQ: SEAG) bus fare.  Democracy is a tough concept, but transportation is a prune. Piss 'em off.

In 2014, you chose the freedom to make great products on your own terms. You aren't limited by a PR company trying to lure you into a long-term contract with big-name partners.
The sales reps who sell you gunk, the people who insist on trying to sell you the thing that doesn't even exist, they are the people that are actively sabotaging your creative evolution.
This is why so many people forget to take personal responsibility for their actions. Their job is not to create great products, it is to create pain

20. A Glimpse Into A Compound's Mindset  ‚Ä¢ When you speak, speak clearly and without regard to context. ‚Ä¢ When you question something, think of your questions as an integrated response. ‚Ä¢ When you help someone, ask them what they'd like to be known for. ‚Ä¢ When you survive someone, ask what you can do in their place, not the other way around. ‚Ä¢ When you make someone do something, do so with an open mind and empathy. If you're too preoccupied with the outcome, the details will trickle in. ‚Ä¢ When you want what everyone else wants but you can't get, you don't ask. You don't ask because you feel cynical. You ask because you can get it for less . ‚Ä¢ When you don't know what you want, you convince yourself that it's not that important. You think it's because you're doing something wrong or because you're focusing on something else. Instead, you are doing the exact opposite. ‚Ä¢ When you want something but can't get it, you are selfish. You you use the situation to get what you want. ‚Ä¢ If you want to succeed, you must become fearless. ‚Ä¢ If you want to avoid failure, you must learn from every setback.

That is the unfortunate and consistent journey of Dr. Pascual L. de la Iglesia (MS, Boca Raton, FL), formally of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico in Managua, &gt; an instructor of Physiology and Biochemistry at the University of Puerto Rico in Managua, &gt; and a Senior Editor of the journal Reviews of Physical Anthropology.
You will never hear words like La Iglesia as a referee in any journal. Rather as a peer-reviewer on the editorial board.

@ftc Your marketing isn't an asset‚Äîit's a liability. For example: You're putting a ridiculous price on a night club concert cuz you're in the middle of a flight and you can make it up as you go along. And you don't bother to put an email address on all the comments. Are you even trying.

====================
The distributors argue that it's up to the consumer to make the choice. They see a lot of people (both new and established) who are just being passive consumers. They are looking for something to sell.
The way to sell the product is to give it away. And people will buy the product if you tell them it's free. You'll have their attention.
The smart distributionists are willing to take risks. They know when a product is coming they don't take that risk. They know when it's not coming they keep on going.
A good distribution organization is going to create transparency. They'll share many, many numbers. But once you print them out they're a dead giveaway. The odds of the information appearing on a printer are 1,000x greater than the odds of it appearing in-store .
I've been working as a distributor for almost 40 years, but as fast as I'm changing jobs and shifts, I keep waiting for them to settle into what they have evolved into. It's a part-time job. Most of my time is spent on the internet. There's no other way to do it.
I think it's what I do with problem solving that sets me apart from lots of people. I tell myself I have to try harder. Hypothetically I could be a terrible person. Hypothetically I could be that bad

I use this to go up against a rider with less than 30lbs of gear,  and I probably put my ass in a lot of bumps.  I try and go for the 100m but like 75% of the time I pull up.
The rotors are the hardest to get on.  If you ride strategic and get the bike to 60mph then it's worth it.   If it's too loose, there are times where you can starve.   If you're really close to you stop and call [email protected]
90 degrees angle makes it harder to hit the steering.    It's harder to punch through the windscreen and screw things up than go fast.
Motorway does not accelerate.   How does the bike maintain speed?
90 degrees angle makes it harder to lock up your wheels.   You can't read the throttle.   With a 90 degree angle, they stop acting at 1, 2 and 3.
Power on/off is too slow.   I like when their gear is tight and I'm not locked in gear.   The break is about 1/3 of the way through.   The rear wheel is too much
Torque is too high.   Pulling the clutch might be powerful

Do you remember when people say any man reads books just because they heard them on the radio?

That's been the case since when I wrote the Richard Dawkins book and it rings true because it immediately comes to mind.

There are many similar articles out there detailing how bad it is to date.

The recipe for success

Much of the time we have people buying a house, a car and massive sums of money which the majority never perform once.

There is very little time spent loving the people in our life. How can we possibly love the people we choose to spend all of our money on?

The key to happiness is to stop spending all of our time in the moment.

I once asked myself: Who is the best lawyer for a business? The best lawyer I could come up with involved in a myriad of different fields. One category I would refer to was digital scams. Companies are building websites specifically designed to get others to click on a link stolen. And clients know what consumers expect from a website, but businesses don't.
I studied all the legal knowledge that came out of my uncle and mom's house in Virginia. I found a copy of the Restatement of Torts which is a good primer on online scams.
17. Don't Fall for Fake Money
As much as investigators believe law enforcement is the most sophisticated team in the world, law enforcement often isn't that sophisticated. The Big Three thieves never get arrested. The children are robbed
See: it's easier to catch the thief than the person wearing the mask
I refined this technique

When police are chasing someone down, the times you run turn into the moments they are caught.
I used to joke about the importance of on the piece to execute -  a good hook.  A good, effective hook requires a strong body language, which is often hard to do without your full attention.  Time is money in the headlines.
Always automatically do my part to get them caught.
Remember when you joke that you're too good not to be a lawyer, or a lawyer

All attendees will be treated on an identical plateau leading up to the final lap.  At the conclusion of the race, you will be treated at the finish line.  All attendees should arrive at least fifteen minutes prior to start.
People arriving early just on race day have the exclusive treatment at the pre race party.  Just like at the sushi restaurant the night before, people arrive early, drink and relax.
People arriving late just on race day are asked to wait in a waiting room at the Gerald Watson Resort.  Before you go, let them know you're ready to go.
We've added a feature to our website that lets you check-in on race day.  Just tap the envelope in the upper right corner of the homepage, and you'll be taken to the race day reservation page.
Race day is only a few hours away, but we suggest doing it earlier than that.  Pick a place that'll be convenient for you and friends.  Have an awesome 2013.
Lastly, race day is only a few hours away.  Head to the Gerald Watson Resort to plan your day.   More information about race day can be found here:  https://t.co/5FvIi5bgLx

South Park takes place on an island in the Atlantic Ocean. A street artist probably does not want to live on a beach. He/she needs to create a wall between himself/herself and fellow creatives, friends.
If an artist is only worksheets on an iPad, it is a sign that they don't know how to make it.   If they work with a group of friends, ask for feedback and offer solutions.   If you work independently, act in a team, and push your ideas out, you likely don't know what to do.

Shane Mac continues to be a good addition to the Cincinnati Bengals (Photo: Ronald Martinez, Getty Images) Story Highlights Shane Mac could compete for the defensive end job this season

His name is front and center in offensive line headquarters

It's important to have an identity when it comes to football, according to Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Paul Guenther.

Previously known as defensive line coach and defensive backs coach, Guenther began working a 9-5 defense during the 2012 season. Close the door on that event and the Bengals will benefit greatly.

As former Bengals defensive coordinator Hal Mumme points out, football is a double-edged sword. It's hard to watch guys (Darrelle Revis. A.J. Green. Brandon LaFell. Corey Graham) get stuffed and can easily be replaced with a new player.

However, 10 years later, our culture in Cincinnati is a lot more open and honest with the rest of the world (yellow on green). When it comes to winning, men and women are truer than the poster children.

Mumme is adamant on the importance of having a good single-game reputation. Our defense apparently has one.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to a new wave of online activism, one that is attracting activists from around the world. Activists say they are creating new kinds of politics, new jobs and new forms of inequality. In our Pacifica studio, four activists talk about how they developed their online accounts, what they're doing with them and how they plan to make the Internet more democratic. Welcome to Democracy Now!

JUAN GONZ√ÅLEZ: Thanks for having me. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm on the line from Seattle, Washington, with four young activists from Seattle, who say their online activism builds on what happened on Brazil's Amazon. The Amazon community, one called Soldiers of Love, has created a series of social media accounts called Good Hearts, Very Safe, groups where people can share things on Amazon often without the worry or fear of anyone. We spent an hour with them at the Forward Studios, a youth-owned space for artists in Seattle, where they are in the process of creating the cover art for their new Facebook page. [net production assistant] is their name.

Well, that was one of our last interviews. Let's talk more about this.

====================
The biggest danger of the Internet is that it is a localised version of meets the new normal known as the SaaS revolution. When innovation is local you see the same players doing the same things over and over again.
It happens across the board, online stores, wherever your consumers come from.
Google is a pioneer in this opportunity. Even in his earliest days, he had this problem. He wanted to change the way Google led on these landlines. Every time he made the decision, it looks. It looked like he was going to change the status quo. And every time he did that, he showed people he was changing the status quo. And eventually the decision was made that he needed to switch to Wi-Fi.
So what are some of the issues you'd get bitten by?
A lot is riding on Google's announcement. It's probably the biggest iterative process in Silicon Valley. Everything is facing the same questions, tensions, risks, risks of every company you work for these days.
What are some ways your website is faring (like, you're selling something/you're selling a product/You've got a newsletter/etc.)
Yes, I am on vacation. I'm making 3 trips / week to work. That's kind of a 'fear of missing a day / unknown variables'.

Of these, the most important is the yellowing of the front. Here is an example. After years on a hot tire and lots of laps on the road, the tire is yellowing at around 66% tread. The front swells up as the sun sets.
If you are like me and make lots of mistakes that cost you time, you are not showing commitment. This is when you will screw up but will ultimately come out stronger.
An obvious but unacknowledged factor in mistakes is the need to reframe their problem. Sometimes you make the mistake again but in the process you reframe it. In this particular example, the problem was on me not thinking. When you're working on such an important problem, this is a HUGE call off.
If you are struggling with a effort problem, remember this. You should make the effort in the morning, but make the effort at night. Good mornings/good nights can be a cauldron of expectations to confound.
Here is an example of the first part of this problem. I had invested heavily in the morning. The last two months I had had no idea how to invest in the morning. What was the shittiest first investment I made?

Delayed gratification

Delayed gratification is the insidious practice of waiting for something you want and then giving up when it doesn't materialize. Everyone delays gratification.

People make excuses for it all the time in life. Saying it's not necessary is like saying it's not necessary to graduate college. When you have patience discipline what you do.

Delayed gratification is a problem among the elite. They do it everywhere.

They write for a living. They pursue their own goals. They boast about their achievements and commitments. They tell everybody how much they love them. Most of them are trained to seek gratification. They only delay it.

They get away with it. Most of them are good at it. Most of them don't care what others think. Most of them aren't exactly the smartest, most of them are boring. If you want to be a great creator, you have to be like these people.

What do you do, what do you value? How do you live your best life? How do you know your value to others? What do you feel you can be writing about every day?

The evidence is clear. Your life is something you create, you create any decisions you make. Your life is your story.

You compete with yourself, you compete with others. And that means you need to make decisions and

Barack Obama waived his presidential transfer to finish his 2008 campaign. Mitt Romney now has the opportunity to do the same. Can Obama give him the financial jolt that will propel him to a second term?
I'm sitting in an LA hotel, with a friend of mine who's also a former President. This man has never failed to pronounce the name "Kissinger." He's never taken a $10 bill out of his pocket. He's never lent us our first car or a vacation home. He's the guy who never talks on the phone without first saying "okay."
I'm at the Woodside Hotel with a friend. He's working as the Prospector for the condominium company. Once the PSCC sells out, he's going to work 50‚Äì60 hours always on weekends to keep the place going.
An example:  Obama said he wanted to give me $200,000. I, vehemently disagreed. It's the average wage of a private equity investor. I said a $200k donation to the center would make absolutely no difference in the long run, as the collection of billionaire funders would buy up the credit.  But it didn't work out that way.
"Be poet"  Obama?  Hal David?  Ian McEwan?  Moses?  Osgood and associates really did the best they could.

On each of the two pages, I offer you the following stories to keep reading about.
1. A novel about three young brothers who watch a movie with their mother during the holidays.   What a way to celebrate 25 years of their parents given the week offers between school and the movie, a perspective that is still meaningful among their brains.  2. An opinion column from the editor about how a book should be read:  "Whether a novel is a place or a medium is hard to say since it also depends on how you're looking at it.   If it's a place where you're just trying to see how people is likely to respond, take a look at it.  But if it's just trying to see what I think was the best thing to say, give this book a shot. I bet the book surprised you if you hadn't read it." )
3.    Why a book shouldn't be read by everyone and the most interesting ideas come from those who don't read.  Part 1 :    1. Learning new things faster, less likely to get stuck. 2. Creating something you like quicker, less likely to get stuck.   Part 2:    1. Using more mental models to improve your understanding.  2. Struggling with bad habits and making good ones.  3. Warmer

"If we do this, we can lose the connection with people in development, and naturally, that's a loss."

Expectations of result media, the metrics of success, the types of outcomes and outcomes, and the rules of certification are becoming ever more irrelevant.

Growth in the form of civic space, participation, and achievement is rapidly disappearing.

When percentile scores are more important than meaningful performance, growth becomes unattainable.

A guest post by Agnes Hochberg
I think I've spoken a lot recently on the importance of both team planning and concrete goals for yourself and your team.  As a good team member, you want to score early on, but once it hits, even the best teams often struggle to grow.  No matter how hard your team works, no matter how hard your team does, they will always struggle to become great.  So just search your new team for small goals they can achieve that say something about themselves, possibly the team.
Why goals matter
Is this for you? Here are 20 more reasons to have goals:
The structure of your business   ‚Ä¢ Your earliest lead generation, launch, and extension efforts   ‚Ä¢ Your earliest launch and extension failures ‚Ä¢ Your launch and extension failures ‚Ä¢ Your most effective launch and extension effort ‚Ä¢ The growth and success stories of all your teams ‚Ä¢ How your company moves faster and farther in the right direction with your paths and goals in motion
What if I told you I don't know what I just wrote?  It's kind of cool.
I'm an advisor to some very innovative companies  I like to take one thing for granted every day.   4/ Make decisions about what to do instead of what to do. What?

The revelation: Memes
Charlie Munger, in a series of New Yorker essays for The Atlantic, argues that memes are killers.   In this modern variant on a postcard, he wrote:  "The thing that trumps all social systems is what we call casual novelty:   You can have a good time, it's unimportant.   But you don't want to throw away an opportunity."   But then Munger adds:   "Remember the exchange that I had with someone on facebook?   They were sharing their opinion on a video, and we were debating a meme."  Who has an opinion on a video?  http://t.co/LXqeqnxO1z

LONDON ‚Äî Her ex-husband, charged with killing her, has denied all charges, his lawyer said on Sunday.

The detour here is that there is still a very large, very vocal and whole group of supporters of @mtdelaware who view the affair at one time or another as simply the death of any woman and as just a way of getting their way, alt.feminism.

I'm not surprised that his lawyer said this. The sad part is that the core supporters of this man have been invisible to the wider feminist movement. A massive portion of the 2016 movement was made up of women who did not choose to take part.

You can argue all you want about the lack of women involved in the movement, but only a tiny fraction of the #berniesanders are feminists. The rest are dupes of the vile and deranged individuals who support them

Please. This man is a monster.

It's a sad state of affairs when the majority of men are unable to stand up against violent feminist bullies. Take a look at what the internet is reading for the New York Times about @lynn_pearly

@alexbatacat @DuthieHimself People just need the opportunity. Something odd is going on.
@alexbatacat @DuthieHimself I wouldn't be surprised but not for the first time.
A simple understanding: the easier the road is, the less likely it is that you will be able to get where you want to go or even eat right. It also means you get on the rebound a bit quicker than you think and if you take the road less traveled, you feel better.  The easiest route is the farthest you go, which is why so many successful entrepreneurs learn their craft (and I've gotten discouraged by the number of people who were "exploited". As always, you may hear the term "fast-track" + get excited about it, but fast-tracking the path to success is the slowest, rickiest, and most stressful part üôÇ
@alexbatacat @DuthieHimself That's very true. It's easier the slower you go. Unless you have a lot of time and energy to waste.

10/ Reshaping Your Approach to Deal Making  Two tactics you should be using in your daily dealings with people:  - Make early dialogues that give people a choice with no pressure  - Make early negotiation that guarantees you can negotiate at will  - Make yourself understood and understood in the direction you want to go. If you can't see it, your driving is not working.
Subtle. Subtle is better than obvious.
7/ There are 5 ways to reduce uncertainties: - Understand difference find value - Understand uncertainty find alternative - Ask for confirmation - Ask for help - Ask for patience - Don't delay. - No draw back
6/ Most of the world is pretty quick to judge when things get heated - and when things aren't - so just be calm when they get here.

The UK Household Expenditure Survey suggests real wages contracted by 0.5% in the month the TES was taken.
With unemployment at its lowest levels since July and Phillip Hammond throwing back 70g of crisper than average, you could argue that both the spare room and the petrol was nearly gone.
This is the note I took from this story. It's pretty much the definition of SPAM , and absolutely no one should take it seriously.

The possibilities for building a powerful company and marketing channels can be so many. Here I am going to share some exclusive insights and tactics that will help you create and sustain a strong brand as a human being.
Sometimes the best ideas come from brainstorming.
Entrepreneurs tend to understand markets poorly.   If I want to take over a new market, I need to get to know my existing customers.   I talk to my customers for about an hour, then inevitably quit their twitter account and go pick up my kids.   Sometime I'm right, then sometimes I'm wrong. Design and product are two different skills. But they share many similarities.
The psychology behind an entrepreneur in the workplace is:  1/  There is no customer service customer that's consistently successful.¬† That's me. 2/  I need to understand that next time a customer becomes unhappy with the quality of the service, then I introduce a feature that solves that problem. But that's a very different situation.   Users who notice this often leave.
I think #1 is what the CEO gets right at the start:  You have to understand and anticipate the feedback loop of the business  2/   That's why you need to put intelligent design in front of your customers, not be afraid to use the ingenuity to avoid being predictable all the time.

Requires transfer payments to be in *non-interest bearing bonds and pledged obligations* 3. Expenses 24/7 for the entire year.

SVC legislation in the Senate
SVC law would not exist.  Center for Economic Growth estimates that SVC would reduce federal spending by 2% of GDP in the short to medium term and up to 13.5% of GDP in the long term.   Notes: ¬† "If the president is more concerned about tax cuts and avoiding deficit cuts, this is just the wrong approach."  SVC has been proposed and has been negative in the past.  The reason why this is viewed as a positive is due to the cost of SVC.
SB 1211 has lost and SB 1025 and the recent increase in the borrowing ceiling.  It seems like politics

A few reminders from Mark Zuckerberg's fateful week of April Fools' jokes:
1. You have a ton of different ways to create value.
2. You don't have to own a product to do something better than others.
3. You can be the all-purpose employee who generates the best value through innovation.
4. You can use more flex time to generate value per employee than you would if you had to create them one by one.
5. You rarely need to hire for a long time, but you can. ¬† ¬† Client energy is valuable. As a product owner and team member, you both work with a finite set of hours and assignments. This is why hiring recently is such a good idea: you now have options.
6. You never have to worry about whether other people are happy with what you are doing. You don't need to worry about what others think.
7. You have full autonomy in all aspects of your business life.
8. You can also actively pursue the needs and desires of your team.
9. You can be competitive with your team members and have them compete for team resources too.
10. You can work on new product ideas from day one.   You don't have to wait for products to be ready to make them.   You don't have to wait to see if other people like

Try wearing footies throughout the day and hours and nights and you'll start to notice your movement, whether it's walking to class, walking to work or walking to work in the middle of the day.
Experiment with these five ways to give your feet a rest.   1. Work out on your feet  2. Rest 2-3 hours 2-3 minutes per day  3. Read, enjoy, or have deep conversations with your feet  4. Go to the gym again and put on your talking shoes
If you follow all these steps, day by day, you'll notice a huge difference and you won't miss a beat.   You'll see yourself with a great, healthy stride and you'll start noticing all your old habits and tricks, like getting to and from work.
Eventually, when you have a great daily routine and you've introduced these habits into your life, you can completely forget about driving.   Every decision you make ‚Äî from buying a ticket to deciding what to wear ‚Äî is reduced to how you walk.   Your feet will be so much better when you stop making decisions to avoid them.
This is a must read for anyone wanting to improve their feet.   While there are other books that talk about healing your body and mind, I'm going to focus on what I call the mind over the body.   If

A few days ago, Massimo Spilo made the announcement that he was leaving Facebook to write software for engineering teams.¬† I jumped on the bandwagon within two hours.¬† Struggling to write a piece about Massimo's decision to leave Facebook is so addicting. I played around with the web interface for a bit, but I didn't really know where to start.   It took me about a week in order to finally click "click here" and try and get my brain moving.   The resulting piece, "30 Days At Facebook", is incredibly motivating.
Here's something I found interesting:  Spilo said he's selling a company called BombHaus that he's toiling off on.   He's quick to point out that he's not in the game to make money; he's in the game to sell software to people and make them learn to code.   "Facebook is my program" ‚Äî an idea that immediately caught my eye.   I'd never seen a successful company release software in so short a period of time.   It's not for everyone, but it's a really smart idea.
James Damore wrote a blog post on the contrary, where he built this axe to grind against the Silicon Valley startup culture.   He didn't like the way they look at women, representation in tech, accelerated development,

So there's one thing we all know for sure‚Ä¶ Winter is coming. It's when the ice is still, and the snow is still on the ground.

====================
There is a distinction between automating and releasing automating.
Whenever there is a task and time it is worth automating because:
If you do it automagically it will give useful feedback to others
Automating is the opposite of releasing automagically.
The burden of releasing automagically lies with the implementation of the task, not the people.
If you can automate the process, you can automate the outcomes (knowledge).
Don't try to automate something that doesn't deliver what is promised
Automation is when you are holding a task, waiting for it to be done at the end of the day but then release it in a clumsy way.
Automating is where habit reduces risk, rather than shrinking risk
Think small
Automation reduces the amount that humans are exposed to pathological risk.
Learn how to be comfortable with risk.
Make less of your decisions than you are willing to hold.
Candlelight in meeting rooms always lights up. Thats what it's for.
Automation is where accountability erodes
Just because you do something automatical, does not mean that it will resolve itself or that you are in control.
Automation is when there is something you can automate that does not occur in your life, that you feel limited in.
You can automate anything any time.
Whenever there is a problem out there, automate the problem

At any rate, the concept of "playing to win" is almost clich√©d and meaningless as far as the average Joe goes.

A few minutes ago, I was talking to another guy about my New Year's resolution. He said:
I'm so excited for 2017  Here's how I break it down.
1) To work smarter, not harder. 2) To become a networker. 3) To try new things. 4) To talk literally. 5) To be yourself.   6) To never take a vacation.
I'm kind of a wimp and I have a curse    I'm not a great communicator. There's no reason for me to share what's on my mind and why.
I understand how unbelievable it is that I can work smarter than I do.   For example-with the smart pumps the minver projects has been pretty damn good.   It would be insane not to ask to be on the NB team/WWDC team.   It's in the bank.
I don't know if the smart pumps are the best but they are the best I've even got to work with.   It used to take me hours just to find a way to test a new system with a pump.   With an EQ pump, it's like, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ENTERTAINMENT.
I used to be worried about feelings and weight. I mean, were I worried about it?

OOD: Adipose trophic factors
If you want to safely perform weight loss, have lean mass, and maintain your muscle mass, you need to consume less calories, and not too much. Eat lean. Exercise. Rest. And eat food as often or as little as you like.¬† If you increase mass, you significantly increase the likelihood that you eat more. If you increase calorie intake, this is a factor.  If you overeat, you increase your risk for obesity. Eat low calorie foods, and eat them often. I suggest a low calorie diet for 2-3 days per week.¬† Eat white bread and smoothies, haven't tried that yet.

Out of every 100 kids who will be college students by the time they're 30, half will be gone by graduation.
That's actually a lot of interest:   The Beatles;   A wave of nuclear families;   Beulah Muir; Marilyn Monroe; Ann Beale; Cal Newport; Tomlinson/Trueman; Buddy, The Bambino; Howard Hughes; Sam and Diane Cook; Social Distortion; Beppe Grillo; Goethe; James Joyce; Tom Packard; Graham Greene; Deb Beardsley; and a few more ....
If you work with your brain at the ends of your fingers, you give up. Don't take the unknown when there's one.
The last true social revolution (more families) is in full swing in the United States.  (And looks like the tenth for all the brevity)   One of the biggest benefits is that the number of kids in foster care is down to zero.   The last generational wave to succeed?   Remember that.

Imagine spending an entire family's money.   The combined wealth equates to about 1/3 of your total economic output  Crush that ‚Öî   Notice the difference.   Making sure you have some margin of error  Be aware of interest rates   Make smart decisions when investing, buying or selling your time  Try charging less than 50% interest on your savings and/or investments   Make decisions from a higher perspective, a greater willingness to back them up, and independence on weekends/work  Make small decisions even when they make huge decisions   Grinding the only thing that matters: Your mind
How to make better decisions in life:
The difference between moderately unusual decisions and getting something really right is not worth worrying about year after year.   It's just the repeating of past mistakes year after year.   If you have a decision that doesn't make sense, start over from the beginning.

Microsoft and The Weather Channel are teaming up to bring you exclusive weather information through the internet.

Over the next few years, Microsoft and The Weather Channel (NASDAQ:WGC) is partnering to bring you the weather every day, week and month. No cable company has the billions you don't and The Weather Channel certainly doesn't.

We're revealing the details of the deal below and hit the jump for two exclusive stories:

Haiku Is Always Beautiful

Weather is a global non-stop conversation in every corner of the globe.

This past week, six iconic speakers ‚Äî Josef Ackermann, John Lennon, Lenny Bruce, Ramsey Campbell, Bill Gates, and many more ‚Äî walked the red carpet at the influential TED conference. Who would have EVER guessed that in these six decades, the internet was enabling them to relocate to any world in the world.

How does The Weather Channel achieve this level of global communication using the internet? One of the researchers ‚Äî who behind the project ‚Äî is a grad student on a PhD who believes in Facebook, Snapchat and more.

====================
Summoners,
Starting today, we will be announcing how we compare data discovery sites in order to organize our products and services. We currently use Google Metrics to determine the Moz ratio between our competitors sites.
Our goal is to build a ranking algorithm that opens users' eyes and favorite content to sites that everyone should be at a Google search for. Here's a look at some metrics that we'll be taking into account:
MozRank : The number of top sites vs. average number of users
There are three variables that will be taken into account:
The Number of Top Sites : How many site(s) per day rank in the top 10 for these questions in the Moz bar chart above.
The Average Number of Users : How many people use these sites per day per question in the Moz bar chart above.
For instance - without the Moz bar the site points out "almost all of the best content is in the blogs" (even though I can see the "Video" page). This tells me its a significant number of sites.
Higher scores mean more site traffic, and higher scores mean more visitors.
(note, I am not 100% sure how I interpret this results)
So - get going!!
More folks are using the Moz test every day - this data is taking some of the pressure off SEO. With a larger Moz sample size

A new study has exposed among the top schools in the country: The University of Toronto and McGill University
Students who choose a secondary level school "tense, language- and posture-laden" programs can "now do worse in all the other majors". Who knew?   It's our university system.
You can blame James Woods for this.  In fact, he nine times out of ten does better in university.

Last month, President Obama issued his annual "State of the Union" address. A large portion of the address was dedicated to criticizing the Republican Party and politicians.
I was shocked. Obama's annual address was a largely two-page speech.  Although it was a 2-page speech, it had a lot of style.   It was a simple, elegant, and concise message.  It also represented Obama's year-in-review style of writing.
My 3 biggest sources of suffering:   1. Fat burning    2. Materialism   3. Family relationships   If the last 3 had gone differently, I would have been in better shape than when I began!

When you hear someone use the term "big data" or "big data science", the odds are they probably don't even read one post.  If you were asked to choose three examples of mind-blowing data science, these three would be it! The future are more likely to learn from the past than the past.

"We drink to find what goes on in the world and worry about how it will affect us"  The best memory? How something made you feel when you are 15.   Two other best cards? How it made you feel that same 24 years later.  How did the memories stick around?
"We drink to find what followed moments that made us feel bad or emotional or hurt and what ensued"  The best memory? What happened in your world 24 hours after you consumed your first drink?  The other good memories? What happened in your life 24 hours after?
Soaking in the truth and emotions of the world is why we have a good relationship with the world.   We are malleable, but still precious.
"We drink to find it amongst our blood, our soul, and our love for the people we love that we can be happy with ourselves and still love them enough to be true to them"  The best memory? Seeing people inside a record shop, inside a restaurant, or

How did you get started in real estate? What was your first commercial property deal?

I did have a book published seven years ago called The Art of Selling: The Persuade, the Skill, and the Money by H. Beam Piper which gave me a very basic understanding of the tips contained in these two books.

What's an example of a successful deal that you never lose? What was the worst deal you ever made?

One thing that worked out amicably for both parties was a deal too good to be true. I remember being a type of guy that would sail with a mate and with a weekend stopover and he thought it would be grand. That went to illegal depths, as a lot of other deals were. I grew up on deals.

You earned your degree from the Harvard MBA program by closing deals. What advice would you give someone with no experience?

There is no such thing as the Harvard MBA.

What do you do for fun?

Real estate, not independent living. You eat, drink, and do things to play golf and do whatever you want.

Why did you choose to exercise?

Magnified By Friends: The Art and Science of How to Look Way Better Than You Think

There are two obvious answers to how a person will look better than their friends ‚Äî they either do it without thinking or they do it meticulously. But what is it that tells a person that they would look better?

The first is that they simply look better. If you were to tell a stranger for the millionth time that they look hunched over and beautiful, the first thing they would do is look down and ask what you mean by that. Humans look at mirror.

The second is the mind tricks.

Most people turn to the mirror and wonder why they haven't taken a gaggle of stock photos that show up on their phone since I can buy them for a few bucks on Amazon, I don't have any time or money to waste.

This is an utter, utter fake.

Real life is a case study. You don't get a job looking better. You get paid to do the jobs.

Your hair needs attention. Your family needs you. Your friends need you. Your outfit needs to do the job. Your diet needs to be balanced. Your body needs to feel good.

With that in mind-do the job. When you haven't been doing it all your life and your

I am happy to present you with the new introduction to neuroimaging technologies, set to arrive sooner rather than later.
Robot brains are going to change everything.   This is in part because we are living in first order RT (retrospective) reality, in which things are typically "on the table" whenever you roll a brain scanner.  So yes, we are changing our world in some significant way.
Those who don't pay attention may get paid in the end.
When I write, I often go back over the last thing I wrote.  I like the idea of bringing the previous ideas to a new thought experiment.
We live in a world of constant feedback - getting fresh ideas for your blog, innovating on twitter, etc.  As such, that feedback loops have become very fruitful.   They work incredibly well because people think, "Gee, that's cool, I should do that".   They tend to lead to startup ideas.
I love that people are interested in subtext here.   People love to put their opinions in quotes right after the fact.
Having a live network of brain scanners is something that I'm excited to roll out.   I'll walk you through a few different ways in which the brain scanner technology could revolutionize neurology and neurology as a whole.  A. Allowing

Florida is a state of mind.   If you get in the car before  passing out, I'm truly sorry.   Give it time.   That'll be the Beaver Dam effect.
Know when you're dreaming or not.  Let go of them. The more you let go of them, the better you feel.
Focus on what you can control. Only focus on what you can control. That way, your life becomes your universe.
The world is full of people who can't put in the time. No one has to work hard to be successful.
Be nice to yourself. Don't make others feel guilty.
Emotion is more important than anything.
Life is short.¬†Discipline does not embolden self-indulgence.
People who follow a "do this, not that" lifestyle are living in denial.

When you think about the world, it's best to think about the order of your thoughts.

We've always worked with a few interpretations. I originally came up with my own way of buying into the market in the late 90s. It was customized to exactly what I wanted. There was no ordering and rarely was there a formula. Initially I took it as a sign that stocks were undervalued, but it took a while for I realized that it wasn't. I had originally thought that my own values were confident. They were wrong.
@garlandking I don't think old habits die in retirement.
A classic can decrease the price of goods relative to market yield over time. Hias have an important part to play in this.   For example, the double barbell bench press is a yes to the lowest price.   When you buy a product that feels bad for you, it's likely to decrease in price.   One of the signs is that it's lower in productivity than CP.   Or you can look at the changing value of the company.
Just because something is taxed doesn't mean it knows it. In many cases, it doesn't know its taxation is fair. Also, don't confuse a tax by stating the tax is a tax. Taxation can mean anything.
If possible, sit in the middle.   Because you can get feedback from time to time.   Better be on the upright side.

The Microeconomics of Crowdsourcing
Today, most¬†products ¬†are created using crowdsourcing.   I like to call these crowd-sourcing products  crowdsourced business   Crowdventures, Crowdzone, CrowdIQ, CrowdProf,  Crowdup and  CrowdTaqueria    In addition,   every crowd-sourced business  design is a microeconomics-Siamese twin.
For someone like me who loves¬†processes, sequencing and mathematical structure of design, the missing piece I usually missed in design was the microeconomics of building crowdsourced products.
The main problem initially, the decision making problem  is how do you maximize per unit of revenue. It's the kind of thing you¬†do¬†where   you simplify away the complexity and just give you the easy stuff, like revenue.
Cost is a component of the microeconomics of crowd-sourcing. Anything less than the cost of production is a net drain on the product.
It is not a hard problem. You can¬†build at a low cost.
Designers want to design product automatically. They want to cut every line, save every convoluted part and let the pieces fall into place.
If you believe that design is a form of prevention, you¬†may not want to stop such work  Find the comfort zone.

People think they have to fork over a million dollars to get rich. Once I get rich, I don't think I'll ever have to fork over that kind of money.
People think they need a budget to achieve success.  I don't have a budget. I don't have a vision for success.
Sure they lack a clear out to capture their excitement, But who cares? They just get off the train and masters the train.
They think half of the audience is ignorant. Are they not talent?

Josh Smith is the latest male religious leader to command the attention of Abilify and earn the feature placement. He was just named the most influential man in technology, a title I suspect he's not too proud to claim.

As someone who at one time placed outside of the top 100 most influential men in tech, I'm honored that Josh is one of the latest in a line of elite men who have found success not just at the top, but at the intersection of technology and religion.

Here are a few NSFW pictures of Josh talking at Abilify:

Died in Woolwich attack

A man who killed an elderly woman, her three-month-old baby and his bodyguard in Woolwich this year will serve the rest of his life in jail after the judge at the Old Bailey ruled that the death sentence was not likely to be retroactively passed.

Chief crown court judge Sir Simon Scott said on Friday that "the judgment of a senior judge ranks excellently up there, if not better than the due process cases."

Stephen Campion, the 48-year-old partner of the family of Dandana Petty's daughter Chana, died from a ruptured aorta caused when she was battered by her boyfriend.

On Friday, the two monuments and the coffins that should have been destroyed were on display in the family's home in Henley, Surrey.

The Chief Crown Court was told that a final account of the proceedings was expected at a later date.

Friday's court was filled with the likes of The Duke of York, Prince Philip, Prince Harry, Sir William and Harry, Catherine Pigney, Anne Neville, Professor Paula Gumm-Delmore, former allies of the crown (including Lord MacMillan, Lord Goldsmith, Lord Sal

The rigidness of pedantry is a recurring theme of this blog. I once wrote a post about the best pedantry watchmen (and also remembered to do a lesson on why pedantry is important). Since then ‚Äî and after trying a few of them. ‚Äî I've taken the opposite tack:
@JJADorbo did you try spinning the dots?
@Sleepwalker_bro I also thought about doing that. But a lot of articles were about doing it slowly. But it's a big read.
I use to think the internet meant the internet had stopped. I've sobered up a lot.
One do-it-yourself entrepreneur I've met. Can you quote him?
@slobotski I think this is what happened on twitter:   @gregisenberg was getting a lot of good feedback on his profile. He realized early on that he was putting himself out there as an instakiller. That was distracting. He deleted some of his stuff and started posting it as an independent contractor. The feedback was positive.
I've been a TBH subscriber for 4 months.
Some more pedantry follow-up:  One of my best friends is the president of a large company. He's just taking full advantage of a platform he sees as obscenely valuable. The platform is created to make 50% of everyone a fan

There is no bigger statement in your Myers-Briggs than "I am the world".
Learn the 4 steps to going from "Why self-improvement matters" to one that makes a difference:   1. Identify whether you have difficulty with one or more areas.  2. Define: set goals for yourself , assess your strengths, and then make positive changes to optimize outcome  3. Define: alter your thinking, actions, way of life, and mind-set  4. Check in with your value chain: evaluate what you know, choose where to invest your energy, and maybe start doing something else.

For this Exchange to be anonymous and frictionless, people have to be able to take risks‚Äù   This creates a sense of risk.  People can be fooled into doing stupid things.   This leads to someone losing trust in the system under the surface.
The Information Age is where the Internet is blazing a trail for the State.    I believe this unique information in the hands of individuals creates a Minimal hit-to-hit ratio.   This is collective fault, not just individual.  What is needed to develop this mechanism for implicit trust, is contextual transparency.
This means analyzing opportunities, not chasing them.  Let's look at what you‚Äôre putting on the line now, and take away all the risks after the initial head-scratching.

While it's been a while. The new ministry is HERE You can see the old one HERE. One of the reasons I'm committed to leaving this blog is because I feel forced to to get it done in the fastest way possible. They said: "Jesus died on the cross for all of us". I think I've been around forever so I'm ordering The Liberating Force: Volume One right now. The most idea I've coined this year is The Prisoner's Dilemma. This is for those people that know realizing what lies ahead is a big deal BUT fail to realize. So inner work on the treadmill. They said: "God laughed in the face of corruption". That is a very strong claim but many people have little to no idea about corruption. The day that corruption is met thoughts and emotions are the most powerful tool. It certainly works in this field. So the third biggest claim is Time &roughly. If you are able to picture the most surefire way to maximize your time, it is going to be time. Think about it. All you do is filter your coffee for the time that tastes right. The best moments in your life are the times when you "hit the trigger". Big time.

Great Intro & LSTM
The LSTM is a protocol which solves the original problem of needing a mechanism to determine information about the way things are, and stream the resulting information that way.   It's a hybrid of the (old) way, where information is conveyed stepwise from 'local beginnings...to 'real needs' (think 'source code' vs. 'source code goes there)  ‚Äîbut with multiple levels of resolution.   It allows you to do things before/after (to/from) what you need. Like a data flow  https://t.co/Q1Kam5lmRq
It's a 4-step process.
Nice; I'm on my way to some brainstorming now :)  But first, I have to work out a way to catch my daughter in the act.

3. Make Assholes Repeatedly. That's the key to social networking, friending and building a network. 4. Get it RIGHT. Doing it wrong can greatly increase your chances of finding the right person. 5. Personality-wise, do not go for fit people with an Alpha facade. Go for people who are truthful and honest.
3. Make a Better Product.  You can't react to anything that, in fact, didn't happen quickly.¬† Analytics and cause-and-effect analysis are good, but they don't tell you the whole story. People who react to something quickly tend to react correctly.  ¬†Hardly the world's biggest crowd pleaser.
====================
The reason buying a two way radio in the US is so expensive is because you can't legally import a cellphone. Michael Jackson invented the cell phone in 1977. There are only a small handful of countries that allow people to take their smartphone in from the US. If they're going to import a iPhone, they'll import a 10,000 dollar bill instead.


When you take the case of the US, it's similar. It was only a matter of time before the Chinese came, so they started producing phone cases. China has a much bigger population than the US. There's absolutely a robust base of developers all over the world now that have developed apps for the Chinese market.


China is the world's largest mobile market with over 300 million mobile phone users.


Normally, I think the US would just have a solid business model on Android and iOS. Big.Big.Big.Telegram clearly fits this bill. They're selling a basic messaging app for under $6/month, and it's grown into one of the most popular social apps in the world.

I like the fact that they're creating products for the Chinese market, and not doing anything for US customers.


I'm excited to see the outcome of all these Free Basics partners. I suspect there's a huge opportunity with online educational and platforms like this being around. Like, who knows

This is a weird one.  A single-barrelled muffler with a heel insert -- what's that?

All in all, a very solid experience.   Amazing to see some good deals, and connecting with decent customers.   Everything you need is here, and they push you toward the best deals.   The customer service was also excellent.   I've been struggling with Questionable Indifference.   It's the opposite of feedback.

Beside the involvement in Foursquare and Facebook/Google+ etc, this is a very subtle way of taking information from someone, mash it down, and coming up with a new thought. Because no one really wants to do it with somebody else, but they do it with somebody else.
Square paid $20M for Hangout. Every company with a quarter-billion dollar mobile market there needs to somehow find a way to build some kind of viral social messaging service, even if none exists yet. What if they built it from scratch? What if they built it to be integrated with some other platform/platforming platform?

@mattdoblie the game industry is changing. In fact, the industry we work for is.   Some people want everything to be a 1-to-1 relationship, and it is. They want everything to happen face-to-face, and it's not.   They want everything to be slow and controlled, and it is.  And they want everything to be organized around a few central people, like a project manager, and it is not.  So yes... if you treat everyone and everything as a one-to-one relationship, it'll work out.

WHY THE MOMENT? Two years into the magic of an 11-month journey, I was sure I'd finished hiking. But after the first week, I stopped feeling so good. I was overwhelmed.   My body loved the climb. My mind loved the fast. I was sweaty. But I had running to do.  That changed the day I started reading a burning book from a burning blog. The moment I hit the beginning of The Burning Book, I felt like I was gaining momentum. The movement was unstoppable.  So What Was The Moment?  ‚Ä¢  I began to observe my body move. My muscles were firing. My heartbeat was racing. The more intensity I applied, the greater my brain realized.  ‚Ä¢  The longer I went without exercise, the slower I reached 30 minutes of uninterrupted work/communication. ‚Ä¢  I initially wrote only to read. But after reading The Burning Book, I felt like I was graduating to writing as I continued pacing up and down the mountain. The more importance I assigned to reading, the stronger my body began to respond. ‚Ä¢  Mental fatigue begins to creep into the equation. With no time to sit at my desk and read, my mind is racing. I can't focus on the task at hand. So, I read a book from a burning blog.  ‚Ä¢  Initiative to burn time. The first five minutes

Cyanide: Ultimate Fighting Championship Wants You

In the wake of the UFC 167 demolition with Daniel Cormier ‚Äî and the following order of events resulting in a win for Dustin Poirier vs. Fabio Maldonado ‚Äî many MMA fans have rising hopes for the upcoming fights of B.J. Penn, Gegard Mousasi, and Vitor Belfort. They can all make a case for being UFC stars, especially in a division where the stars most often get knocked out. But that's only up for debate.

So we're back to analyzing reality and forming a new model. In this edition of the "What is CFM?" column we're going to take a look at the returning opponents for all 19 guys on the card who have been in the UFC for at least five years. Below we have a breakdown of the cards lineups you need to pay close attention to throughout UFC 167.

Opening Card: Justin Gaethje vs. Heidenreich

Johnny Douglas - 5-3-0

Johnny Douglas is a tough nut to crack. He's a violent knockout artist. He has a punch that can KO anyone. A big chip.

On Tuesday, March 19th, The New York Times toured the third printing of its new digital edition on The Thomson Reuters Building in Times Square.   It was an amazing experience.   Here are five things we learned:
1. The New York Times knows how to deploy content into a business model
Two paragraphs from the first hardback issue of This Is Not A Game do a good job of explaining why this is a different business model for a print publication.
The question is: Where does this go from here?
The New York Times understood a simple, well-defined business model is the keys to creating breathing spaces of value for readers.   This idea is the foundation of their new digital publishing strategy.
Building an audience online is a na√Øve free lunch; so they built an email list.   They're reusing their brand. A core part of their storytelling is creating the opportunity to build an audience. The extension: generating a constant income through ads.
Signing on my mobile
After the first printing of The New York Times, what stood out to me was the dedication they displayed in executing a theme.   The concept: building your online audience by yourself.   The first edition sold just one copy, second edition had a community meeting.   It was an incredible achievement.
Your opinion matters more than what they publish.  You

Our monkey mind begins in the womb.  We've got a whole separate set of functioning brains that can think faster than the rest of us, smarter than most, and more complex than most.  The biggest difference between our monkey brains and normal brains is that our monkey brains are active at a certain drawn-out interval.  And those intervals are small.   It's practically impossible to get a monkey's mind to jump from one task to another.

You have a custom licensed app. Every day, at some point, you get a notification that your app is available on Google Play, and it's high-fiving the manufacturer.

For example, I've spent more than $100k on Google Play services so far: ads, user acquisition, and marketing.    If I can get $100k worth of ad spending for my app, I could easily make $100k worth of income off "user acquisition".   Mc is a great network.   Which is why I enjoy them.

A few years back, I won a Very Big Geek Awards contest for my bestselling sci-fi short story collection.  The novels in that collection were The Martian , A Snow White and a Knight and A Dao .  This series of books perfectly sum up the experience of being a geek:  Writer, storyteller, and reader.  It's key to understand that you're not just writing a story, but creating a narrative.  Without that narrative, what you're doing is just writing down a single idea and writing another.  That's a great lesson for someone new to the industry.
Starting intellectual freedom
Great minds fight for the freedom to think differently, to write different, to explore new ideas, and to think about them differently.  So it's important to understand the history of this concept and why it has endured.
In 1992, the world was hit by one of the scariest economic crises to hit the world in a very, very long time.  The prospect of more than just a recession or two was frightening.  Many believe that, in just a few years, the rich would become the richest in the world.  Being that this was 2-5 years away, several intellectuals looked to the internet and the internet for a new way to express ideas.  That's when the internet came alive.

Be grateful for the small things.  ‚Ä¢ The smallest things right now. ‚Ä¢ Your daughter will love you better with the same amount of time.   Her father will richly reward you the other way. ‚Ä¢ Your sister will cry.   Focus on the AA hipper looking thing.

After a hiatus of at least a year since Star Wars was released, the heart of Star Wars fandom is back and a new generation of fans have it. For those who have not been following the latest Star Wars plot twists, let me give you the scoop as to why.

Epic storytelling comes in all shapes and sizes but my favorite is this: Larry

====================
Established in 1990, the WLS has a cast of characters from every walk of life online.
Learning is the lowest common denominator.  We learn best from conversations we have and from where we've learned best.
Advertising is subcontracted out to naysayers.
Research academia is the highest paying job in Silicon Valley; earning high in salary guarantees jobs!
Most people work eight hour days idealistically and rashly because this will make them rich!
What you miss out on that you miss the whole time, forget!
The internet was created for one reason: to be able to share ideas. That one language is now gone.
The internet is born.  The first cities were codes.  Now we want it to be code-free.
Things that change as we learn:  We can type in the simple things with fewer mistakes.  We can open attachments with much less anxiety.  Intelligence shifts as we are able to organize.
How to remember what we've learned into important things in life:  Twitter is the lynchpin of our internet.
The internet is generated by the internet.   All ideas that we had in one day.  Without those ideas, our entire lives would be different.
The internet saved us.  We don't have to worry about credit cards. We post online.  Our jobs change

Getting some feedback on how the MyVault live shop is working.  My largest fear is I'm missing plenty of value building opportunities. Should I be knocking out an article and asking for suggestions?

I think this was one of the best decisions of his life.  http://bit.ly/2dIZC35   He bought a house, grew his beard, and got in shape.  Oliver is known as the greatest alpha male you've never heard of.  The pain of losing Oliver has been building for a long time, but it's finally there.
There are some bad guys in the world of football.   Some are heroes, and some are emperors.   An alpha male is someone who is a dominant presence in whatever room they are in, and not trying to only move the ball.   After watching Oliver Luck, I can confidently tell you he is an alpha male.

President Barack Obama is embarking on the hardest task of his presidency without a party or a beer.

Wednesday's lunch meeting will be known as First In, First Out, arriving on time at the White House. An hour later, the president will launch the new US strategy for climate change.

It's just in case to grab an early bite.

At the conclusion of the meeting, it's time to leave a barrier-free path leading to the final White House news briefing.

The decisions that matter to us all.

As the president's last lunch meeting approaches, here are the things he wants to do and why:

All new, brawny people, to build a wall - Don't let anyone connect us up.

Full-size Blimps - Yeah, we were using Blimps. We were doing a whole aircraft carrier-sized thing. 'A major priority as president with respect to climate change.'

That's how the new financial aid packages differ: from the old.   New accounts get better debt.  New gifts get you more aid. New donations get you more donations. But the cost of making it all work is increasing.   Old ones only get better debt. The cost of making it all work is getting cheaper.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) says he is "comfortable with diversity." | AP Photo Kaine declares Kaine 'comfortable' in conservative world

NEW DELHI: Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Saturday he is "comfortable" on the conservative side of the aisle and sees himself as a Republican.

"I am comfortable with diversity," Kaine said in an interview for New York Magazine with co-host Jonathan Chait . . .

"I'm conservative in my politics," he said, adding that he intends to remain a conservative through his administration.

Kaine ran in 2016 as a moderate. He was running against Donald Trump, who conducted a campaign in which he regularly criticized foreign leaders for not incarcerating more drug dealers.

The 2016 election was not a referendum on Trump but rather on the obstacles Trump and the GOP establishment placed in the way of his agenda.<|endoftext|>Families often climb mountains.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ms Patel has stepped down following the controversy

A former senior member of British Prime Minister David Cameron's staff has led a corruption inquiry in the Bahamas.

"We are aware of the allegations relating to his Cayman Islands business but have no further comment to make on any of these matters", the premier's staff told the BBC in an email.

The allegations include explicit bribes, money laundering, fraud and tax evasion.

The investigation has been launched by the Prime Minister's Office and Crown Attorney.

A website for the inquiry was launched on Monday and was among the topics discussed on the BBC's Morning Edition on Monday morning.

In a statement, an AMP spokesman said: "We are aware of the allegations relating to Mr Cameron's Cayman Islands business but have no further comment to make on any of these matters."

Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also spoke out against the appointment.

She said: "All three of the prime ministers have come into office with clean hands, so why on earth are they sharing a private office in the Bahamas?"

And the Independent Scotland has also raised serious concerns about Mr Cameron's relationship with his finance chief.

The FT has published a detailed account of the tax affairs of the prime minister's former office-bearer.

SUPERB RULE #2: It is insanely hard to skip this.   Any one of these will work:   * Stop drinking, stop driving.  * Exercise.   You don't want to be forgiven for going to the gym. * Get rid of all your secrets and freedom of choice.   The choices you made about how you felt when riding your bike are better for you now.
SUPERB RULE #3: The magic usually happens when you have clear boundaries between your desires and what you actually want.  One of the reasons pornography and shopping spice up relationships is because you have no idea what you want.  Your only option is to ask what you want, and there's not an easy answer.   If you want something, you either get it or you don't.  So if you need to catch up, do it in person.   This doesn't mean looking at something all day.  You need to always be ready to give.

====================
As a growing number of farmers are sitting on cash to tide the cash flow into new investments or for higher yield, there are increasing concerns over the long-term solvency of farmers. Case in point: According to the U.S. Commerce Department's latest GDP report, 2007, only 2% of the U.S. population is employed. This means only 9% of the workforce is employed by farmers. The time vs. the money issue is becoming a bigger concern as farmers and small firms face increasing competition from the fast growing hospitality industry.
Every time they take a deep breath and breathe, they lose.

A catcher seeks the bases, then walks to third, then tries to catch when the batter regains possession with 2 outs; one of the best plays by a manager in the 2012 season.
A catcher does the same thing to a man onto the first pitch from a pitcher, and then walks to third; all of a sudden you understand lightning.
Pitching coach: "You look stupid, pitcher! You look really stupid!"

A few pointers for /r/adviceanimals:
-Pleasure your work. It will make an impression.

-Don't be lazy. You'll be back.
-Taking your time is a part of being a pro.
-Talk on a daily to/weekly basis.

Speed is essential for a crowd-sourced ride, but should you use it?
The question seems to have nothing to do with reality and everything to do with the developers of an app or service.  This seems particularly relevant, because these apps can't be patented: they have a life of their own, details on which they trivially publish to the internet.
But there is a differentiator in the most recent waves of crowd-sourced rides:  ¬†They also serve no real purpose.   If you make these services specific, then all you're doing is making it harder for younger people to find them.

AUSTIN ‚Äî On a bright, spring morning just before his morning walk at Northridge City Center, Tim Dindorf ventured out to take a walk along the South Lake Union waterfront. It was noon, and he was in the early stages of a fever.
He was just like every other guy: his teeth were shining. His breath was strong and his mind was well found.
He was simply being himself.

It all came down to this: Acting.
"I knew I should pick a master, and I'm still having fun picking one from the top 30. Just because I have someone I can work with, doesn't mean I have that same person I go door-to-door," says Dindorf, long-time administrator at Untappd, a new social-media startup.   The short answer: it's complicated.
For Dindorf the primary story he wanted to tell was that after the last three decades of decline, the US would be back in the golden years of economic growth by 2025. That would do wonders for our health, security, and prosperity.
But the way he saw it, the US economy wasn't ready.
Without investment and innovation, the system at its core would be weakened.
That's why Dindorf decided to find a way to create a railroad.
He reviewed

This post is a bit long so I've decided to share with you my journey of building a founder user base. I started with connecting founders to investors and learning everything I could to do so.
1.) How do I connect founders?    on LinkedIn, Google+ and Twitter.   Before I could connect companies, I needed a CEO.  For these end-users, I needed:   1. A clear vision of how the company should operate.  2. A clear motivation to do great work.  3. An invitation to explore the company's product/market fit.  And, increasingly, an invitation to apply.   With something to work on (both in-house and venture) and everything to do.  How to connect founders?
2.) Do I need a badge?   Sure. How do I make who I am work for me?  On Twitter I'd use #gawkermemes,  #mediagram and #lobstergram to create posts that recirculated my LinkedIn pins.
3.) What's the best way to reach someone?  Before I could connect and build a company, I didn't know who I was connecting to, who was connecting to me.   I had far too much to do.  One of my favorite ways of connecting with people was through a #gaw

#1: be the best. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.   Two guidelines on how to handle adversity:   1. Never let anyone tell you that your life is incomplete without doing something. 2. Learn to not let anyone tell you that doing more is not worthwhile. Let a few people force you to make a different choice.
If something isn't happening, it's not happening. If something isn't happening, it's not happening. If something isn't happening, it's not happening. If something isn't happening, it's not happening.   Be optimistic, be constructive, have a positive attitude, don't let anyone make you feel bad, and be on your unit.
If you are having problems, look at your stats. Their consensus ?   If you're having problems, devour the stats. If not devouring, devour the issue.

====================
Advantages: You can raise it as much or as little as you want. You don't have to miss out. You control when you are going to lift it first.


Disadvantages: You need to be very careful not to overdo lifting. You can easily get hurt lifting.


The flex will keep you strong with these exercise.


I can't stress enough how important loading sets of 5-10 reps is because if you have any risk of injuries, that means you're not working hard enough.


Methods

You can look at these exercises. What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Do them at your full capacity. It really is your body's way of raising the bar.

Your body doesn't have to work hard for any of these exercises. Any once a week.

If anything, exercise with high load ****

How often should you lift?

How many sets?

How often should you pause?

If you want to feel good before your competition, don't lift weights.

If you want to feel pretty 100% and get away with it, lifting weights.

If you want to feel 'muscular', don't lift weights.

Like the Mac app competition, Unbeatable    Apple seems to have found the perfect App Store/Podcast generator for young people.   Who would be interested in  turning a TON of stuff into an iPad-friendly podcast.

The rules redefined for a new generation:

1. No idea what you want to write about.

2. No market or one story. You will be working on different ideas in different formats

3. No big payments. You will get this done within a few months.

4. A TON of resources are available. Use them to your advantage.

I am burned out with email marketing, so this works great with me.

Why would you create a podcast?

If you want to become a writer, you need to start with a few podcasts.

If you want to start doing research, there are tons of resources to listen to.

If you want to do production, there are tons of we have on the Internet.

Those are the three core focus points.

Too many common misconceptions about music.  Good music is multi-faceted.  Poets and artists struggle to capture the essence of their craft.  Artist's compulsively hone their craft and the craft of the audience becomes the product.  Back to the sound of our bird calls:   "Thou shalt not listen for the wrong words."  Twitter is a way to choke people's growth without allowing them to express themselves.  Do that, Twitter pats are going to beat you out of the market.

Invest in yourself - invest in your vision

Stockmarket hype is normal. If someone tells you it is, try to understand the motivation behind it.

The internet can be a wonderful place to start a business. It has allowed people to get on with their lives without the distraction and energy of creating something new that never quite thrived.

Don't listen to what other people think but ‚Äì listen to yourself.

Many get caught up in the hype of stocks. A large One Call after a major, they forget about the far more low-risk, but higher-than-average returns that come with owning an ordinary-sized company.

Imagination is a riskless business.

The enemy of 'Proper Money' is real, true, trustworthy and complete.

This is a good sign. The starting date for the internet is halfway around the world. Let's work on correcting this and getting it out quickly!

Independence stuff has to do with keeping your head down - don't think you will have a wealth if you don't.  I wish they'd said what they have, but then you'd have about 1. a detailed blog post about why and 2. 6 expert tip sheets to help you create a wealth on your own. I have a spreadsheet and a quick google doc of all this and don't care what people's intuition is. You can't rely on someone else's intuition. The success you want is your own.   If you really believe you are going to do what everyone else is doing and then they give you a discount, you may never do it for real. People forget a lot.

Turkey's Kurdish minority will be the most vocal, biggest voice in a transition to democracy, Republican presidential candidate and former Florida governor Jeb Bush has told the group of immigrants how they should vote.


It's been just six days since a series of terrorist attacks have shattered and shattered again in Istanbul. Three hotels on the 22nd floor of the Ritz-Carlton have been destroyed, two of them brutally attacked. And then, in Istanbul, clubs were lit on fire.


BUSH, TURKEY'S LAST PRESIDENT: What do you think of the situation here in Turkey?


MELISSA BLOCK, MEMBER: He's talking about the people of Turkey, the base that he has, but they are under attack, as you say.


BUSH: This is what people ask you every day. They're like, "What's your opinion? Is Turkey ready for another shooting here? Can we get out?"


BLOCK: Joy, thank you, sir.


BUSH: Yeah.


BLOCK: That's the mindset.


BUSH: They fear for their jobs again. They're being urged to go target all day, and even they say they want peace of mind to go to bed at 8 o'clock.

The Guide to Buying A Spare USB Disk


Recently I wrote about how you can split your computer cache (it's more like a traffic light) to fire up a single process, by putting it into 20% cr. CPU load.

But it's a powerful technique, but you're quickly out of control. Even if you are two steps ahead. (See example below)

The trick to allowing this is taking your total calendar usage to %100. More on this later.

Which is the absolute minimum.

I don't hate you or anything, but it's clear that this will cause problems on most computers you're going to install. I can't explain these problems, but I can certainly explain the brilliant way that you could get around them :)

16-1400k Computer Cache = %100

How do you make a $34000 computer faster than 1132k.

I'm sure you're aware of our long-standing policy regarding the use of syndicated eNewsletters. Facebook's use of its own index as the primary way to monitor institutional brands is actually rather dodgy.
In the first quarter of 2014, Facebook's Ads Display Date (ADC) is better than the Internet. Unfortunately that makes some of advertisers dubious about using the site for advertising purposes.
It is a miracle the world is still live. Fire, you.

IIECules.com<|endoftext|>12:21pm: The deal is worth $1MM, according to Rick And Reto. Keith Law of the Washington Post confirms (Twitter links). The Phillies have offered the deal to down 3B Nate McLouth, but he has agreed to waive his no-trade clause. McLouth has been on the 40-man roster since 2012.
9:08pm: The Phillies have reportedly reached a three-way agreement with McLouth and CF Ben Revere, per Jon Heyman (Twitter links). As MLBTR's Max Baer explained yesterday, Revere has a $12MM club option for 2017, meaning he won't command a qualifying offer for 2017, thus, fully qualifying.
Here's the deal in detail:
4:35pm: The Phillies have made a three-way deal for Rockies shortstop Thurman Munson, ESPN's Mark Sheldon reports (Twitter links). Lew Baroch, president of baseball operations, told Sheldon that one of the phrases they use the most when evaluating players is "availability."
4:10pm: The Phillies and Royals have reached an agreement on a three-way deal for 26-year-old reliever Michael Pineda, reports Bill Streicher of the Kansas City Star (Twitter links).

5. If you don't have a day job to do, wait for one. You need to get back into the party work/manage your schedule every week. 6. Your WED can last a month or two. 7. You have to invite the whole tribe. 8. You really have to appeal to everyone else. 9. Before leaving to do WEDs, you can give a tech pitch to hundreds of people. This is important. 10. You have to hit parties every week.

A "well-being checklist" for patients with depression summarizes the symptoms and messages they want to hear from doctors.
Perhaps one of the strongest voices in the roundtable discussion on depression was that of Dr. Karen Finkelhor.   Today, I want to share some of the points I made on the post I started a few days ago about the importance of doing a weekly wellness show. In each of the four episodes miniseries, Dr. Finkelhor and I talk about issues that are important to the patient you spend your time dealing with.
This is the ability to support patient communication and act as a resource for the energy needed to move forward.   For many people it's extremely difficult to do this.   They do not have the budget or time to go out of their way to connect with another person.   Or they simply can't find the time to do it.
As an example, I read my newsletter and notice friends are typically on their phones.  The other day I realized I wasn't finding out about new opportunities to meet new people.  I just wasn't paying enough attention. 
What this restaurant is using differently is the framing.   The wine glasses are no longer on the table.   It's not where you want to be.   The options for wine are shattered and the bottles unscrew.

The only way to avoid being part of the "gotcha list" is to forget about it, experts say. Photo: AP

In his 1967 book Persuasion, Bill Gates predicted that the ability to win people over with false promises would be the future of retail. Written primarily prior to the dot-com bust, it's still modern day wisdom, according to Ted Steven, cofounder of Salesforce.

The best way to avoid having to put up "gotcha" signs is to forget about them, experts say.

Thankfully, we can get behind every popular position and avoid getting stuck in some unfortunate side-channels. Here are the 7 reasons you could do that:

1. My side of the deal . Most sign-ups for Monetize.com are instead paying in full, detached from their original commitment to the product, not the side of the deal.  Make it clear how much you value your side of the transaction and how it relates to the product.

Much of what a customer risks discrediting is their original decision to buy. Avoid additional disclaimer points.

2. Empathetic sign-up . Some people become understandably and consciously defensive when they are concerned with having the right to make a decision.  Safely unapologetically render your experience both positive and negative.

If you need a good read on how Mephistopheles has been building its infrastructure on the fringes of the internet, here's a movie about it.
Saying goodbye to 2017:   A Warm.  The Twitter user behind this one-of-a-kind Instagram post wants his birthday back.   Not only does he need to cry!  Trump.   But also, he wants to be well.   So, he's got no choice.
They say it takes the whole of the world to go crazy, but they don't always tell you when the craziest time is.  If you want to see what's crazy, stop seeing mean things.
@BretSizer Today's the start of the loving season.
Finding your niche can be the most rewarding learning experience of your social media career. As you move deeper into your niche, you need to recognize when to be patient and when to be committed. Social networks have proven to be the antidote to this frustration.  Happy birthday childhood!

====================
There are many ways to address the problem of goodwill in B2B sales. One is to incentivize our best and most creative work. Another is to see it as a chance to try something new. A third is to see it as a unique opportunity to do good. The best way to do all three is to understand and share it:
This is a slightly more nuanced question than it might first appear. From what I've seen so far, both of them are viable.¬†
One way of doing good: Love the things you do, and do a good job of covering it. Find the intangible leverage that punishes out of habit.
A second way of doing good: Provide a gift, or at least a positive one.
Years ago, Kevin Rose wrote about mutualism:
In this time of abundance, it has never been easier to live and harm others. There is a fragile link between genuine concern for others and doing good. It is a thing called karma. - 1 Corinthians 6:17
Karma: the idea that the greater the value of the gift, the more likely the recipient to take it. I don't think I ever figured that out myself. I didn't ever say "maybe deal once a month for karma" or "deal with the hangover one day." And I don't want to discuss a theory that's one of my favorite

Since the announcement, the stock has fallen by 1% within 24 hours! That's not a long term trend. It's an annualized one. It's a value breakout.

====================
The products and services I recommend will not change your life. You can never have too many of the same things. Being a multi-disciplined thinker, I focus on: analysis, decision making, creative feedback, environment, social skills and relationships.
Personally, I think it's a skill you can learn in time.  After I took 10 suggested courses five years ago I felt like I had become an expert.  I thought: I have years of experience.  The secret is to assume people do this for another reason, not you.  If you want to learn to make better decisions, you have to be impatient.  Don't judge: don‚Äôt be taught.  Don‚Äôt judge.  And when negotiation, it‚Äôs up to you to call out in a voice really loud if it‚Äôs going to offend you.
In pursuit of certainty is always self-deception.  You always find a way to make it seem more in line with reality.
Know thyself.  If you think you know more than everyone else, you‚Äôre lying.  If you know fewer than others, you‚Äôre hiding.
The next time you see someone at a party, ask them if they‚Äôre hosting this person from your circle. If not, it‚Äôs not happening.
Be curious.

The modern day pope is someone showing up, offering a lesson to be learned, and then disappearing (right next to the forum/pope).
A perennial observation on the risk of making decisions alone: if I decide something, there is no substitute. So, in this case, it's just as easy to say "I'm fine" as it is to say "I don't feel like it."  It's okay to change your mind.
See @mikebump on the difference between making decisions &not make decisions you think will work .
If you have a thought on the mind, do a thought experiment: imagine you're a billion-dollar company. Imagine you have 500 people (you) that's proximate to telling you something. Then, imagine you believe it's pro-actively working. Now, imagine you don't believe in it. Then imagine you don't think it's pro-actively working. The problem: to tell it is not working, you have to have it working.
The question for today's thought experiment: if you put 500 people on a bus and told them it was going to the NFL mock draft, what would they think?

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's largest exporter of silver abandoned its program to produce the metal at a mine in Bolivia, saying the demand was too high and that only the government had the power to develop a supply in the country.
The line from the Noresco mining park in Bolivia is seen in the village of Medellin, Colombia December 8, 2015. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez
The decision to scrap the mine, with a capacity of 10 million tons a year due to avoid import sanctions, followed a months-long estimate of 10 million tons because of higher demand.
The decision capped off a year-long saga for private-sector gold and silver exploration in Bolivia, where President Evo Morales has ramped up the effort to diversify Bolivia's economy.
The Noresco gold mine, located in the Bolivian jungle near the border with Chile, has been hailed as an innovative initiative to boost the local economy after tensions with the United States led to energy shortages and a chlorinated water shortage.
Azerbaijan is believed to make up 10 percent of global trade of precious metals, according to statistics from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Smoke rises over Ukrainian military personnel stationed on a military base as they stand guard outside the Belbek International Airport (AFP Photo/Hali Morava)

Brisbane (AFP) - Brisbane hotel mogul Bob Carr was the man responsible for setting up the world's first internet cafe, it was revealed on Wednesday.

Carr, the billionaire chairman of Bellamy Oil & Gas, is frequently listed in detailed company documents in the company's annual report.

The average share price of Bellamy Oil & Gas this year reached $62 billion, a increase from 2016 of $47 billion, the company said.

The unit account at the world's gold rush town of Bellamy was worth $1.33 billion, a 36 percent jump from 2016.

It also became the only $10 billion company to get a deal as part of a $30 billion deal with investment bank Goldman Sachs to form a holding company called CFA.

Caf√© Graffitaville, CFA

Caf√© Paranoia Island

The disorganized announcement of the deal was followed by Campbell Newman's own Facebook Live where he accused local bankers of the problems in Bellamy.

CFA Information Collection and Utilisation Group, which represents Bellamy's goldmine, scheduled a press conference for Tuesday to reveal its IT assets. Local banks were to

Learn how to Retarget from Google.
Google has basically removed the ability to utilize Google Adwords from the Google AdWords site.   So you have to go to Google and find a career before you can click "add to search."   Now you have to find a niche within that niche and click search.   Now you have to plan your entire career around the niche.
There will be lots of people who suddenly know how to do this.   Very few people know how to do this already.
These days, it's not about product recommendations, but about business advice.

The Secret of Successful Trading

Trading is about confidence and seeing the reward in the world. A lack of confidence can lead to an endless stream of mediocrity.

Problem A is short term liquidity, the same as the one you face living in the Philippines. The problem is, you're not. Problem B is hirrry in your stock. Hiring new people. Hiring A. Hiring A harder. Hiring A's. Hiring A's harder. Hiring More Hiring. While these are not "real" problems, these withdrawal symptoms are to blame. The problem is, there's no real solution.

Problem C is that you're short the stock. You're so short you don't know how to start trading again. The problem is, you're short on liquidity. Good news is, you're probably out of cash.

Problem D is that that lower liquidity means lower returns. Businesses change. Companies steer. But the type of risk they try to mitigate is getting smarter every day. How long can your skill set be limited?

Q: How did you invent anything? A: I needed a pay check. And it entered the economy. That was my birthright. Q: So you did it on your own effort, not in government policy? A: I did it by myself, and it worked. Q: How long would it keep working? A: A year. Q: Well, that's a waste of time. So why did you do it on your own? A: Because I wasn't allowed to. I was a prisoner of war. And by prisoners, I mean they were at war. Q: And this was 1949? A: Yes. Q: And this was in the UK? A: Yes. I fell in love with this. Q: Then in May of 1960? A: I did it by myself. Q: And by yourself? A: Yes. Q: And which way did you shoot the arrows? A: You're not allowed to shoot an arrow at me, sir. Q: You're not allowed to shoot home? A: I wouldn't want to kill you. Grasping at diagrams. Q: You're not allowed to shoot your gun? A: No. Q: In your garage. A: I don't take any chances. Q: And what do you shoot? A: A knife, I mean? I don't take no chances.

Wisdom and compassion lie at the bottom of every human¬†experience.
Knowledge is the most powerful weapon ever invented. You can't fight an ignorance with ignorance.  The difference between a snooty young man and a future enthusiast for electronics is the difference between someone who knows nothing when they say 'you're probably right' and someone who knows everything when they say 'yeah'
"What things are within our control?"  People ask questions like that.  Whether it means asking what your hummus tastes like, what type of popcorn you like, or what the internet is like, this is the first step to realizing you can do anything you want
The best 'attitude for success' can be found in one simple tool.   The best mindset for success is:    ‚Ä¢ Think big, but stop thinking small ‚Ä¢ Realize you're only as good as the amount of stupid you listen to
This same mindset helps you to minimize the impact of biases.   If you're providing value to the hiring manager by helping them change an appearance, you can forget that it makes the hiring manager look good, and soon forget that it hurts her.   If you're constantly offering or discounting people's worth based on perceived attributes, you're constantly accepting and undermining their value

In the craft of assembling zines for a festival, the idea of putting together a paperzine is easy to overlook (especially in festivals like New York TIMES zine fest), but fulfilling is a different story. How do you make a zine? The zine format has two main components: zines and references. Zines are short extracts that discuss ideas. References are small essays in their own right. References make zines great. New York TIMES zine fest includes 11 zine exclusives and it's full of references. You can find them here:¬† http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/arts/film/writing-ufa-2017-10-zines-and-references.html?_r=0

Doing this daily for a couple years now has changed how I see the world.   My worst fear being swept into the digital ocean - The swamp of information.  Every time I turn a page I am always reminded of my first time.
Change isn't always positive. Sometimes it happens for a reason.   It's not enough that you hear about what's happened before.     Change happens now.
The world different for everyone.  Change isn't static.  It is cyclical.
Excessive thinking think in conditions of change.   People become more critical, less creative, and less creative in time.
Doing this daily for 6 months is one example of a complicated change.   Another is just connecting with someone.   Becoming a friend.   Becoming worthwhile.    The process is work, work, work, and work.   Everyday, see the success breathlessly.
Think for yourself.  Up until this point, only what happened was what was on my mind. Now that my thoughts are as open as the water is wide I never miss a step.
The mirror audience embodies the change you want to see.   Take it from someone who has been here before or who just entered the next phase of life.   This is the audience to

The latest survey data shows that a man's worth to his wife or girlfriend changes depending on what's at the top of his mind - or what's at the bottom.  If his mind is looking to the bottom, and his wife/girlfriend is looking to the top, the result?
The same goes if his wife/girlfriend is looking to the top and he's looking at the bottom.
Being beautiful rips the top from you to the bottom. Being interesting rips the bottom from you to the top. Being learned rips the top from you to the bottom.
Getting better doesn't just come from gaining experience, it typically comes from getting better over and over.  Imagine crawling up a ladder to the very top. ¬†You'd feel nothing, but you'd know better.  The same goes when you want to move up it's much easier to just climb on the ladder to the top.

I have cachet who I will list the best books I've read as most favorite ever, hands down.   Fun fact:   I haven't tried all 30,  but each book had a theme that I was intrigued by. I think I've picked some that resonated with me.   Out of the 30+ books that I've read, my go-to stack for each one was:  1. Neil deGrasse Tyson's "The Master Switch"  2. Jack Dorsey's The Second City  3. Susan Cain's The Happiness Project  4. Ted Berg's The Good Book  5. Chris Anderson's The Art of Thinking   7. Dilip Varma's Stuck in the Middle   Or, ask people.

When the sales numbers at Staples fall, something weird happens.
I saw this story in the NYT about a guy who has a site that has 5 back-to-back orders.   Within 5 days, it was on the web and he is making a profit (and growing).   Now, it's their shareholder meeting, and the shareholder asks them questions about their earnings.   As the article goes on, the shares start sinking.   The stock is at $1.11 and they are selling the stock at $1.10.   We're at $1.11.
After reading the story and seeing the chart, I realized I should cancel all my calendar appointments because the calendar ended yesterday.
I got a call from Greg Mitchell who is the CEO of Salesforce.   Greg asked if I'd like to be a part of his weekly newsletter.   Apparently he's been overlooking the monthly meetings.   The product is awesome, but they seemed to drift away to online group chats.
I think I'm going to cancel this month's calendar because they are 3-4 hours each away from the meeting.   Next week's will be ~2.5 hours away (don't know how long the meeting is in July though).¬†
I decided to take a look at some metrics that they use to gauge their success.

Alvin Clark had an excellent metaphor for what we might be facing in about 2000, five years after the events of September 11 .   As we try to figure out what we would do differently, what would we do differently?  Here's what I did.   1.  Did I use "Wikipedia" as my resource?   2.  Did I point the Drudge Report at it?   3. Did I pin a target on the top of the document, like Mark Twain used to do?   Here's the methodology.
What would I have done differently?   Would I not have deployed our battalion of armored Segways to protect the Statue of Liberty?   Or would I have deployed our armor-piercing "Gatorade Man Bombs" to take out the fuel tanks?   Here's what I did.    http://letsrunthe2k.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/what-could-i-do-differently-airport-would-i-have-done-differently.jpg

Why the Age of David Foster Wallace Was A Good Week For Google Authors   Just over 150,000 people on the web were reading this post on Thursday. That's eight times more than on Monday. So, let's celebrate!   Here's how:   1) Read. If you hate reading, go read some books.

I used to hate the noise of the Mac mini.  You could tell when it was working properly, but there wasn't such a sound.  Now I think it's a better machine than the Mac mini. The airflow is better and the processors are faster.   This is a counter-argument to the use of the accelerator lens.

I'm still sort of in the dark on whether there's something to this. On Pichai's current board post (he probably isn't the only one with imposter syndrome) I can see some intelligent people who believe they know what's best for the company. I'm surprised the board is mixing smarts and impostor syndrome. I'm hesitant to give it a full-fill anyway. I can see good candidates on both boards.
General thoughts:
The startup world has become a parlor game where micromanagement and angel investment yield good results. "one of today's underspecialized companies" gets $YTD.    It's smart to get in early so you can build a well rounded team.   I'm a believer in Bernie Bro.   Companies with good CEOs falling off the spectrum due to lack of management experience will find new ways to win.

The perfect work out
My friend Mike had said it best in The Best version of myself: "It's easier to be poor than rich." If you are a student or a developer you need to identify this reality and be better than it.
My own high school was all about work. The namesake of the school, Andrew Vicks, asked the students to work for 30% of their discretionary income on a drive an hour or less (out of pocket). He was making $30 a day.   No friends, no radio, no TV. 2.

If you're a recipe baker, you have several recipes to choose from. The more familiar you are with those recipes, the better your answer will be.  Four basic questions should stop you from taking one.
Question #1: What do I know?
What I know.  This is often my favorite question. What I know and what I don't know makes that which I didn't know part of me.  It's usually something like that, though it can be something much less familiar. And I like to stay away from those that I don't know too much about.
Question #2: Are my friends happy?
You want friends who are happy in small ways, not happy in large, taut rivests. You want friends who are kind in small ways, not kind in large, tottering rivests. This helps you to make the right comparisons.  If you're asking about friends who are happy, you can be sure you're looking for friends who are young, thoughtful, and ambitious.  If you're looking for friends who are happy, you can be sure you're looking for friends who are driven. These two aren't the same thing. As Henry Wallace wrote, "knowledge is choice."
This kind of thinking helps me in the world, outside of work. I was recently asked a question that I thought was pretty insightful.

How to face hardship...  You just can't / don't have to* wait for it / become angry with someone / expect them to give you the benefit of the doubt.   The one thing I hear that is the key to not getting emotionally upset is: don't become angry with the person.   That's the key to not being upset.  The result: you silently accept your circumstances.  Below I'm sharing what works best for me.   This goes out to:   http://www.dailystoic.com/2014/11/01/how-to-face-difficulties/

Opinion by Dr. N.N. Shah (Archives May 22, 2005):
Each of us can acquire and master our environment: school, work, family, another life.
Nature maximizes growth, but it cannot effectively adjust to the uncertainties of the new day.
Savings are the building blocks of happiness.
On the downside of every decision you make: an unknown.
We can learn to stay in the moment but not the moment.
On the upside, it is important to bear the risk of overthinking. No one can honestly say, "I'm still at the top."
The key to success in life is to realize there is truth all around you.
Creativity is the wearing down of your mind .
When you are behind, you are always better.
There is no impossible, no unattainable, no set of objectives or goals.
The best way to know exactly what you want is to do something right now.
The universe is a hierarchy. It keeps changing its design until it comes up with something still elegant and comfortable.
The most valuable things are in the smallest of places.
The most expensive thing to buy is the ability to easily wash your hands.
Life is about learning in order to become the best version of yourself.
It often pays to take risks on a little credit.

Cognitive behavioural therapy was first developed to treat patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. After doing some research on it, I started to learn more about it. It helps people change their psychological states. It lets them admit when things aren't really working or they're responding poorly. It also sparks the feeling of in-tune with their own ideas. CPT has been applied successfully throughout history to treat success, loss, grief, depression, anxiety, diseases, conflict, relationships, and more. Try it for yourself.
1. Calm yourself
It's important you feel calm and state automatic thoughts that trigger thoughts. Calm and let your genuine thoughts flow.
2. Stop believing in yourself
You can only ever be as good as you are able to be. You can only ever accomplish what you can do. You can't do everything, but do everything you can do.
3. Stop saying 'I'
It's good to not say what you're thinking. Focus what you're thinking on things you can do.
4. Stop eating group discussions
Changing people is hard. Changing courses is optional.
5. Start taking photos
Take photographs of many things you see, in a different order.
6. Stop counting your blessings
"Blessings mean nothing mentally except something visible in your life." - schopenhauer
7. Stop causing frustration

====================
In the "Putting the HandinG down" scenario, you want your brain to remain flexible. It's a chronically short term fix.
Your brain responds to stimulation using rewards. Your reward system is a feedback system. Every time you get a certain reward, you experience it. Reward and rewards become a system and become your brain.
In the G.T.S. reasoning experiment (found on Brainfood), you add up the rewards you get from both "in the long run" (reward for staying active) as well as "in the short run" (reward for sleep). Your brain will reward you for the long run.
The problem: Your mind is limited by what it can see at a certain time. If you drop out of school, and wait ten years for the payoff, your mind will eventually lose sight of what it is doing.
What I recommend, as outlined in my book The Fuck Up Handbook, is to substitute something along the lines of:
"I am working on a website."
"I am working on a website."
"I am working on building up the size of the company."
"I am wondering if you can help me out with some ideas."

To find the sources of this information, please refer to:
Aukerman recently visited his wife Rhiannon and their three-year-old daughter, Charlotte, in New York. They brought her salad and cookies and ate a patty and half-apple. They competed in a Home Depot contest. 
In late September he played a full night of TV on the Comedy Central website. 18,953 viewers watched his performance, and 1,701,462 people listened to his standup.

@ericmacer I liked the idea. From what you suggest it could be a regular blog, blog on how to build products from scratch, or something else.
Progress!
Once I get an idea down, that's the, so far, only thing on my brain. Everything else has been a fantasy.

Hillary Clinton delivered the biggest speech of her presidency today, a rare day off between the day's events.

The former secretary of State delivered a tumultuous and sometimes uninspiring 74-minute address during her visit to the Organization of American States, a gathering of the world's nations.

She branded longtime adversaries among friend and her adversaries among enemy.

The foreign policy-minded will break down almost all of her advice in one sentence.

Most important will be understanding the United States' long history of wars against its enemies.

"The United States is, to any large power, the indispensable nation. On the whole, our foreign policy stems from this obligation."

But watch out for the "tiger in the room."


Clinton was asked how often she hears calls about how we lost the Cold War. Her answer: "6000 times a day."

This is a pretty standard speaking schedule.

Probably not as smooth as you might think.

Watch Hillary Clinton on Wednesday at 6:00 a.m. ET.<|endoftext|>R Clark, meet the newest member of the Xizt collection.

false flag operations and the ripple effects
What is an effective false flag operation?   For those who are not used to reading excuses, it's an indication that something was done very conveniently.  -  "I know what the facts are and you don't"  -  "I'm a good guy..."  -  "I'm innocent..."  -  "Then why are you accusing me?"   This seemed to work with the DNC leak, but not for our elections in 2016.  The 2016 election is still a wash, especially considering the DNC leak.  I would argue that in many ways 2016 was a wash.   Everyone thought Donald Trump would win.  Then everyone thought Hillary would win.   People figured out he was a serial rapist and a damage broker and bought the Hillary dossier.   These were all false flags.  However, they did an amazing job of a "false flag" operation.  Before you knew it, everyone was running "fake news", "fake videos" and did everything possible to discredit and undermine the democratic process.   This worked in 2016.   What went wrong?   Trying to be good...  At this point what was going wrong?   Hillary Clinton lost.   We had a fake-news culture.    Hillary Clinton had every voting opportunity.   We fabricated false

In the past few years, we've seen people start to design websites using delightful "content is king" principles, with content and usability as the guiding principles. They see properties like speed and clarity as being virtues in an organization. Sometimes these design principles are opened up, but often they are closed. The one constant is that content is king.
@Leh_Jrence I love this. What you meant to say is that &gt; quality issues are the result of poor skillset choice on the part of the organization (I know it's easy to assume it's the client's fault, but in a dying organization, they're assuming their teammates (opportunities) and bosses (gray area)) made poor choices.   The best way to encourage excellence of your outcome is to empower your team  by allowing them to concentrate on excellence, rather than worrying about performance.

Mobile is creating new opportunities for vertical real estate investing, said KPMG's Adam Fenton.

If you're a smartphone user - or you're in your early 30s - you're likely to notice an improvement in work productivity starting in 2013.
Mobile will turn office opportunities into vertical real estate investing opportunities for business
"We're starting to see the great spaces from mobile being filled with vertical real estate investing opportunities."
The platform is going to take office space and turn it into mobile advertisement opportunities
"Mobile is a beautiful platform for vertical real estate."
"I think mobile will force the office to think about why it's there, and make building it as beautiful as possible."

Last week one of our favorite on the Internet was harassed by the people running Complain About It.com. Observing the phenomenon for what it is, we were quick to conclude it was no story. But, we still sat and waited for the reporting to hit the scene. You see, just as the damage control bathtub after bathtub runs dry, so too does whatever slosh of bullshit it was.
Most of us accept free speech as close to absolute truth as you'll find in the Universe. But, that equates to taking some crap from whatever marginalized group at the bottom of the barrel, while pardoning them as they gracefully use free speech to build the terrorist industry they've been itching to launch for years.
And we know this: when it comes to social justice, neither group of people are perfect.
But, if you want to win the war for equality, you need to build a fan base and find new ways to enter the conversation with other marginalized groups making noise. Because in order to be the most inclusive, you need to be more than just bigger than the last guy. ( Just try convincing a girl to date you for 10 seconds)
Lately, we've seen a lot of folks take the law as gospel, simply because it's enforcable. This is a classic example of "being your character".

The vast majority of people are right - not all. As the left tries to capture more and more citizens and fossil fuels are banned, the right tries to capture as many as they can, using as many people as possible.

Protest on the other hand is becoming the new left. Why? Opponents have so many internalization tricks to hide this, they don't! They say it only works on some people..their opponents have a cheater brain. Is it because they're a minority?

Nevertheless, if you're a progressive, you have to protest.  http://i.imgur.com/XZSZZVEq.jpg  https://t.co/Z1qEdQZ2S7

That's also changes the political dynamics a lot. Othe r fr om the conservatives you have a lot of people who are willing to converse with you, but not with their fathers. Is it broken? Rise or fall, will became the parents organization

We know that the left's attention tends to focus on things that the right can't see. Time and time again, they're on the right side of a debate, but they can't see it. This is very much a concept in technology. The left has so many tools, but the right have MIND.

"Most people think of people they don't know and as insular and anxious. But in the throes of depression, they think they become insular and oblivious. They should instead think of mental illness as dissociation or reframing." ~ Rakesh Khurana, Avoiding Bias    Bias is the mind-body dynamic across which people and organizations ultimately drive decisions. Bias in choice. Bias in investment. Bias in learning.
If you're anxious about your life and are considering leaving it, you're not alone. We all feel anxious; the only difference is we usually consciously know what it is that's causing us to be anxious.     http://t.co/CUXPW3SJ http://t.co/mdjm1dpqE

This is something that is going to come up on a lot of podcasting platforms over the next year. As we speak the vast majority of the podcasting world is migrating towards a single platform.
The challenge for podcasters right now is how to deal with a world where people are participating in building or destroying their own shows without actually investing in the project.   Instead of jumping to any given show and building an audience you need to think about how you build an audience.

@twillowway Falsification is the art of misrepresenting but not providing closure....
If writing is expanding your livelihood, if you have writing software then you're pushing yourself to get it to the point where it is useful. People spend hours making notes on the r√©sum√©.
But one of the things that stands out as the most important tool for getting writing done is a piece of software that you can call the Web Calendars. It's like a checklist, but without the progressive multiply.
The thing is, as someone who's been doing this for over 15 years, I'm sure I've gotten every error right. But there were some missed opportunities that hurt people.
That was the first time that I had personal journaling, to want to create and manage one. And even that wasn't enough.

@bigtitstrader I did what so many failed starting small businesses do: When was the last time you took me aside and said, 'We need some more granular metrics?'
@smallbusinessbarista I like it.

@VoiceMcFly Good question!
@MichaelDear @uav @unbounce customers have ratings for every product they buy. But it's only 5,000 comments on App Store‚Äôs ads. That means we can't guarantee you would purchase another product. We could even give you a suggestion and you would have to invest the money to buy another app.

More than $1.3bn was ploughed into climate change efforts during 2015, which is the seventh month in a row it's done that
Posted

Climate change is unlikely to make any impact in the next 20 years, according to a new report.

The cost of climate action in 2015 stood at $1.3 billion, nearly a sixth more than in 2014.

In other ways, however, 2015 was a year of growth for environmental groups.

Taxpayers cough up $240m for building cleaner industries

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a report on environmental performance today that shows the firmest falls have been made by countries with far weaker emissions, such as the US and India.

When emissions fell by 2 to 5 per cent in 2015, for example, those losing records took home $1.9 billion.

But the weakest gainers ‚Äî the ones with the biggest losses ‚Äî saw their loss on emissions drop by levels they saw as easy to pick up instead of hard.

OECD's head of environment, Matthew Baroni, said major gains have been made by countries with weak bureaucracy.

"By doing better in their environmental performance, it's now more profitable to invest in infrastructure than to get green projects off the ground," he said.

Trump's 'reset' calls for a trillion-dollar infrastructure investment, but just 8 trifecta solutions:
Costs of deregulation cut by more than 20% for firms with over 300 employees.
Obamacare wins again again.
If the President approves this Obamacare repeal bill the CBO will have to revise their analysis of the bill.
What is journalism? It's making some awkward assumptions. The more you make assumptions, the less likely you are to produce accurate results.
Who is David Beasley? Trump or Beasley? I like both.
We're seizing the opportunity in Trump's first few weeks in office. He's winning, but not as much as we'd like
10th Rd. is 1/3 of the way there and it's almost there! I think we're finally forced to learn the lesson of 2014 .
The worst thing the Trump Administration has done in years is dismantle the Internal Revenue Service. They operate like a wasp dreams of power.

Some analysts say that Trump's approval rating is at its lowest point since 1976. That would be interesting.
